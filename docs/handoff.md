### 2026-07-15 overnight — pending-churn analysis + galster re-flow to finals

- **What the «pending churn» actually was (investigated in full).** After the galster
  seed commit `7607db3`, an `absorb --dry-run` showed re-promotions / bulk-promotes /
  assignments across entities. **Conclusion: overwhelmingly benign.** The ~65 curator
  `classification_decisions::assignments` (german_empire→Reichsgoldmünzfuß, danish Nobels→
  nobel_fod, etc.) were ALREADY applied to the finals — absorb re-reports them idempotently
  (0 fuss changes on re-run). The bulk of a full re-flow diff is **field-order
  reserialization** (semantically noop — e.g. schauenburg 146 lines, 0 entries/fields
  changed) + `generated_at` timestamp bumps + `multi_match_warnings` housekeeping. No data
  loss anywhere (`audit_lost_citations` = 0; every regrouped seed member re-lands).

- **Absorb year-hold fix (`e5d18a2`, + test).** The re-flow DID revert one curated value:
  sonderburg `unified-schleswig_holstein-numismaster-120994` year 1622 (curator, Numista
  N#151529) → seed «ND(1618-22)» start 1618. Root cause: the `pure_absorbed` fast-path in
  `_enrich_final_entry` (`composed_of == [self]`) trusted the seed member's year_ranges
  WITHOUT checking `_curation_holds` — the hold-honouring logic lived only in the `else`
  branch. Fix: the fast-path now honours a `year_ranges`/`year_first` hold (dict- and
  list-form). `tests/test_absorb_year_hold_pure_absorbed.py`. This is a durable pipeline fix,
  not a one-off restore — future re-flows won't clobber year holds.

- **Galster re-flow to finals (`9a9b8c6`).** Ran full merger + absorb (with the fix), then
  committed ONLY the real-content subset — `danish_realm` + `gottorp_duchy` (seed_unified +
  final) + the `sonderburg` year fix — reverting the 12 pure-reserialize finals + 20
  timestamp-only seed_unified (pre-existing drift, not this session's concern). Lands: galster
  Schou/Sieg propagated into finals; §9.4-clean regrouping the recovered Schou enabled
  (f1g-55/f1g-60 split out of bruun-4025/4090; hg-36 + 3 kmk merge into peers — all 7 pass the
  over-merge scan, 0 lost); a data FIX — `unified-dk-bruun-4090` reverts a stale reign-window
  «1523-1533» to its Bruun-attested «1532»; c3g131 `_curation_holds.catalog` note refreshed
  (parser fix landed → value now derives natively). sonderburg keeps 1622.

- **KNOWN-ISSUE / possible morning cleanup — field-order reserialize drift.** A full absorb
  re-run reserializes ~12 finals with a different in-entity field order than committed (pure
  noise, 0 semantic change). It recurs every re-flow. Root cause not yet chased (absorb's
  `out`-dict field order vs the committed order). Options: (a) leave latent (harmless); (b)
  one-time resync commit; (c) make `_enrich_final_entry` emit a canonical field order. Left
  for a deliberate hygiene pass — NOT urgent.

- **Christian III Goldgulden split (`82e2d5e`).** Reversed the 2026-06-22/07-02 one-type
  merge: the Roskilde-1536 .764 «Goldgulden» and the Flensburg-1546 .750 «Rhinsk Gylden»
  are now **two coins** (§9.4 — Danish specialist catalogues give distinct bases: Sieg 23≠51,
  Schou 4≠2; only coarse Fr 18 / Numista N#379084 / MB 42 lumped them). Coin A →
  `danish_realm` `unified-dk-bruun-14770` (rhinsk_gylden_fod I); Coin B stays `royal_holstein`
  `unified-dk-hede-c3h14`. Mechanism: dropped the `royal_holstein.yml` force-merge, redirected
  `_cross_entity.yml` (Roskilde half → danish_realm, +numismaster-167746), added
  `danish_realm.yml::year_demote` for the Numista/NumisMaster loose 1546-1547 windows.
  **Foundation trap hit + fixed:** the c3h14 final foundation kept the merged mint/catalog/
  nominal/issuing_entity via deep-merge — hand-reset to the Flensburg coin only, frozen via
  `_curation_holds` (mint/nominal), durable across re-absorb. Denmark shows both rows; the SH
  page is unchanged (this ducal/royal gold is denmark-scoped, as before the split).

- **c3g131 Coin A schou → `1-7` (`ee7d177`).** The Roskilde-1536 Goldgulden (`unified-dk-bruun-14770`)
  had carried `schou: [4, 1351]`: «4» from Bruun lot 14258 (specimen variety), «1351» from
  NumisMaster MC_167746 (its own note flags «for no date issue» — out of range for Christian III,
  Schou per-regent ~1-77). danskmoent c3g131 states the type range **«Schou 1-7»** (4 ∈ 1-7).
  Dropped 1351 from the numismaster seed; added `Schou 1-7` + `Sieg 23` to galster seed
  `dk-galster-c3g-131`; set `schou: 1-7` on seed_unified member + final (+ `_curation_holds:
  {catalog}`). **Verified the hard way:** a `_curation_holds: {catalog}` does NOT survive
  absorb's main enrich re-derive (only the hygiene-fold) — durability rests on BOTH the
  foundation AND its seed_unified member carrying `1-7`, which absorb unions to a clean `1-7`.
  **Root cause = parser bug, documented in `docs/SOURCES.md §13.11`:** `parse_galster`'s
  `_parse_description_and_refs` only scans the `Forside:` block to the first blank line, so the
  `(Galster N, Schou X, Sieg Y; …)` line on a *detached* line (as on c3g131) is never extracted →
  `catalog_refs` empty. **This parser bug is now FIXED — see the next bullet.** — *(Earlier this note listed a 2nd follow-up: that a full merger
  re-run would re-surface Bruun's faithful «Schou 4» as `['1-7','4']` and need a merger
  subsumption rule or a bruun `_source_errata`. That was WRONG — verified 2026-07-14: the
  range-subsumption ALREADY exists (`catalog_codes.normalise_numeric_index` + `schou ∈
  _NUMERIC_INDEX_FIELDS`), runs at all three chokepoints — merger `_fold_catalog_indices`
  (`merge_seeds_cross_source.py:3350`), absorb `_normalise_catalog` (`absorb_…:1485`), render
  (`compute.py:663`) — and collapses the plain `4` inside the plain range `1-7` to a clean `1-7`.
  No merger rule and no bruun errata are needed.)*

- **c3h14 Coin B nominal → «1 Goldgulden» (`990f750`).** Renamed the Flensburg-1546 piece
  (`unified-dk-hede-c3h14`, Hede 14 · Sieg 51 · Schou 2, .750 gold) from «1 Rhinsk Gylden» →
  «1 Goldgulden» so both split pieces read consistently (Coin A is already «1 Goldgulden»); Hede's
  Danish «Rhinsk Gylden» stays as the alt-name in `note[]`. Durable via `nominal ∈
  _FOUNDATION_IMMUTABLE_FIELDS` (absorb never re-derives nominal on an existing final) — touched
  only the final foundation + updated the `_curation_holds.nominal` reason; hede seed left faithful.

- **Galster parser fix — canonical-index-paren anchoring (`d3cb920` parser+test · `8d77786`
  cleaner+test · `67bdb7a9` submodule cache · main data commit for pointer+seed).** The c3g131
  detached-paren bug (previous bullet) is the tip of a class: 34 standard pages carried empty
  `catalog_refs` because the index paren sat on a detached line (c3g131 class) or the page had
  no `Forside:` anchor (c3g92 class). **Analysed the whole 118-page corpus first** (user's
  suspicion «сторінки не стандартизовані» — CORRECT): a naive «widen `Forside:`→first-HR» fix
  REGRESSES ~10 currently-correct pages, because the widened region holds prose / literature /
  neighbour parens («(Galster 30)», «(Galster: <book> side 59)») that clobber the real value via
  the extractor's last-paren-wins. **Fix = two-tier, legacy-first, anchored on the page's OWN
  Galster number** (`_galster_number_from_filename` + `_find_canonical_index_paren`): Tier 1 =
  the legacy `Forside:`-narrow scan (byte-identical; keeps f1g66's «(Galster 66A-B)» summary);
  Tier 2 fires only when Tier 1 is empty and picks the pre-HR paren naming the page's own number
  with the most catalogue keywords. Migration gate (`tests/test_galster_canonical_paren.py` +
  full-corpus diff): **unchanged 84, recovered 34, changed 0, LOST 0** — zero regressions.
  Re-parse + re-seed banked 29 Schou + 20 Sieg; c3g131 now derives Schou 1-7 + Sieg 23 natively
  (supersedes the ee7d177 interim). Also fixed `_PROSE_NOISE_RE` to drop abbreviated «mgl.»
  (`build_galster_denmark_seed`, `8d77786`). **Scope = SEED only** — `seed_unified`/`final` NOT
  re-derived because a merger+absorb re-run currently drags unrelated pending cross-session
  reconciliation (19 monotonic re-promotions, bulk-promotes, assignments); banked in source,
  propagates at the next deliberate coordinated re-flow. **Still-deferred:** the multi-variant
  Schou-UNION «accumulate» case (f1g66 / f1g73 / f1g63 — Schou split across per-variant parens;
  Tier 1/2 keep only summary/first, never the union). Full write-up: `docs/SOURCES.md §13.11`.

- **Galster «Gej» fix (`ffa32bf`).** `build_galster_denmark_seed` no longer emits a
  `galster` / `galster_volume` catalogue field for the non-numbered `norge/hansGej.htm`
  placeholder («Gej» = page-filename fragment, gated by `_is_real_galster_index` = has a
  digit). «Gej» survives only in the coin_id. Test: `tests/test_galster_index_guard.py`.

- **rhinsk_gylden_fod / 72-Guldgyldenfod phase renumber (`4afaafd`).** Curator direction:
  a true «Phase 0» would be only the 2 pre-1514 Hans specimens — not worth a phase — so
  shifted every phase +1: **0/I/II → I/II/III, no phase 0**. Founding 1496-1547 band = Phase I
  (Hans + Frederik I + Christian III, .75), Frederik II = II (.77), Christian IV = III (.76).
  Touched in lockstep: coin `phase` (10 finals + 3 classification assignments),
  `soll_fein_by_phase` keys (both fractions — Δ stays aligned), denmark.yml phase blocks +
  timeline + closing, fuesse.yml description + grundwerte. Phase I label shortened + fine
  weight (2,436 g); Phase I description rewritten system-level (no specimens, .75 only,
  Bergen coin in); Phase III label «мінімально знижено» → «.76 (18¼ карат)». New ref
  `danskmoent-hans-goldgulden-bergen` (Nordbø NNUM 1978/1979). Verified: Δ per phase
  (Hans Bergen −0.557 %), labels render I/II/III, audit_lost_citations 0.

- **🔵 OPEN — Norway Numista pre-1513 harvest gap (audit finding, no code yet).** Investigated
  why N#444264 (Hans Bergen Goldgulden) needed separate harvesting: **every** Numista Norway
  harvest used mission floor **1514** (BO.6 `_BO6_audit_2026-05-20.json` + `fetch_numista_pre1541.py`).
  The pre-1513 Norway body — **105 NIDs explicitly `oos_excluded`** in NO p2, ALL uncached,
  + page-1 of the listing never audited for Norway — is a systematic, deliberate gap. **Asymmetry:**
  Denmark got a `p0_pre_lovkompleks` context bucket (20 NIDs, harvested); Norway got none.
  N#444264 isn't even in the 105 (added post-snapshot → body still growing). **Next step offered,
  awaiting curator go-ahead:** mirror Denmark — create a `norway/p0_pre_lovkompleks` bucket,
  enumerate listing page 1 (public page, no API budget) + the 1481-1513 subset of the 105, harvest.
  Would also firm the «Norway's first gold coin» claim via Schive 1865 / Ahlström-Brekke *Norges Mynter*.

## 2026-07-13 — gold seed_unsorted triage (Portugaløser + tarif-Daler)

> **UNPUSHED — push pending «пуш».** Commits this triage: `d675e1d` `ec52477`
> `cfc1c26` `2202998` `16491cb` `d941f3e` `26977af` `26b7d8a` `cc5f5aa` `be13259`
> (Portugaløser Cases 1-9 + f2h7a classify + NumisMaster 65625 fold + tarif 1-4).
> 36 commits unpushed total.

**Task shape.** Working through the ~212 gold `fuss: seed_unsorted` coins
(danish_realm / danish_norway / royal_holstein, metal != silver), group by group,
classifying / merging / excluding each. Curator-driven, case-by-case.

**⚠ Scratchpad loss.** The session working file
`…/scratchpad/seed_unsorted_gold.md` (the 212-coin list with per-coin resolution
map) was cleaned mid-session — scratchpad is session-scoped, do NOT rely on it.
Regenerate if continuing: filter seed_unified for `fuss == seed_unsorted` +
`metal != silver` across the three danish entities, group by nominal family.
Resolved work is safely in git; open items are captured below.

**Group progress (11 groups):**
- ✅ `1_rosenobel` (2/2 excluded) · `2_nobel` (2/2 merged) · `3_portugaloser`
  (19/22 done, 3 deferred) · `5_gold_daler_tarif` (5/5: 4 merged + 1 excluded) ·
  `0_offstrike_EXCLUDE` (8 excluded — 5 gold + 3 copper/tin/unspec off-strikes)
- ⬜ PENDING: `4_kurantdukat` (22) · `6_guldkrone` (7)
  · `7_goldgulden_gylden` (12) · `8_dukat` (73) · `9_dor_pistolen` (11) ·
  `Z_other_review` (51)

**OPEN items awaiting the curator (all need a verdict — do NOT auto-resolve):**
- **`kmk-136897`** (3_portugaloser Case 5) — KMM «½ portugaløser» but own tag
  «Sch 2» + 1593. Analysis: it's ¼ **Hede 7B** (Schou 2 + 1593 = ¼; ½ would be
  Schou 1). Merge target if confirmed → `dk-bruun-4601`. **BLOCKED**: source
  images down on samlinger.natmus.dk; leave in seed until they return + curator
  eyeballs ½ (17.5 g) vs ¼ (8.7 g).
- **`kmk-122106`** (3_portugaloser Case 6) — KMM «portugaløser» but own tag
  «H 49»; Hede 49 (c4h) = **Speciedaler 1603** (danskmoent c4h49). Suspected KMM
  label error → it's the Speciedaler. Merge target if confirmed →
  `unified-dk-hede-c4h49`. **BLOCKED**: images down; leave in seed.
- **`kmk-298423`** (3_portugaloser Case 8) — undocumented «4 Portugaløser» Johan
  Adolf (Gottorp), unique nominal, no wt/image/mint/catalogue. Either an
  exceptional specimen or a KMM error. Leave in seed; revisit with more data.

**Mechanics used (reusable for the remaining groups).** Same-entity §9a specimen
merges via `merge_decisions/<entity>.yml`; cross-entity relocations (Haderslev =
royal Schleswig → `royal_holstein`, renders both pages) via
`_cross_entity.yml`; off-strikes via `exclusions/<entity>.yml`; classifications
via `classification_decisions/<entity>.yml`. Flow = merger `--apply` (no
`--entity` when cross-entity active) → absorb affected entities → revert the
date-only seed_unified noise (`git diff --numstat | awk '$1==2&&$2==2' | xargs
git checkout --`) → `audit_lost_citations` → commit by pathspec. The §9.4
graph-gate warns «no shared base» on catalogue-divergence + Schou-range +
physical-uniqueness cases (all false alarms) — document the override in the
merge reason.

## 2026-07-12 — coin-table measurement sub-rows (per-specimen повна/чиста/Δ)

> **UNPUSHED — push pending «пуш».** Commit `d04974e` (+ render-neutral
> groundwork `8c67eba`). Full build exit 0; preview (port 3000) rebuilt.

**What shipped.** Multi-specimen coins now render повна / чиста / Δ as aligned
sub-rows (one per specimen) instead of comma-lists; проба spans exactly the
sub-rows sharing its fineness. Files: `scripts/lib/compute.py` (`_seg_rle`,
`_build_measurement_rows`, `ComputedCoin.msr_*`), `templates/location.html.j2`
(метал/проба + повна + чиста + Δ cells, gated on `coin.msr_n > 1`, else the old
`*_groups` rendering), `scripts/lib/style.base.css` (`.msr-seg`,
`.fin-src`/`.fin-alt`, `.sd-wrap`).

**Key design decisions (all curator-driven this session):**
- проба driven by `fineness_groups` (per-SOURCE readings); each row's fineness
  derived from its own чиста/повна + snapped to the catalogue value → проба
  aligns with чиста row-for-row. Single reading → normal `.fin-src` + source
  tooltip; ≥2 divergent → orange `.fin-alt`, each its own fineness source (NEVER
  the weight source). Metal repeated per variant.
- Diameter is NOT a sub-row axis (specimen spread = wear noise) — Ø keeps its
  own `diameter_groups`.
- чиста/Δ tooltips carry the «weight × fineness» derived-source label
  (`_seg_rle` `src_field`); повна carries the raw weight source.
- `_seg_rle` `group_field="fineness"`: повна/чиста/Δ never merge across a проба
  boundary — a weight shared by two specimens under different fineness keeps its
  own sub-row (не дедуплікується). проба itself is the grouping axis.
- `--msr-row-h` 44px; Δ badge 2-line, unverified «(?)» sits OUTSIDE the coloured
  badge (right, vertically centred via `.sd-wrap`); msr-seg horizontal padding
  matched to `.mt td` so sub-row values align with non-sub-row values.

**Verification note.** Spot-checks were on denmark via an isolated single-table
demo (`site/_msr_demo.html`, now removed) + JS geometry — the preview pane can't
screenshot the full 2025-coin page (renderer times out; scroll decoupled from
capture). Reference cases: c3h14 (royal_holstein, .750 hede / .764 galster) and
the reichsdukatenfuss .986/.972 @ 3.49 g coin — both confirmed aligned.

## 2026-07-10 (later) — founding-era reign-span mint/phase START rule

> **UNPUSHED — push pending «пуш».** Commit `8d4d305` (was cf3aede pre message-amend).
> Full build exit 0, preview (port 3000) rebuilt, 10 new unit tests pass.

**Problem.** A standard whose EARLIEST coin is a reign-window placeholder
(`year_is_reign_span` — «1513-1523» Christian II, exact mint year unknown) was
starting its **карбування (mint) stripe** + phase at the nearest DATED coin,
ignoring that the reign coin was struck earlier. On Dukatfod (reichsdukatenfuss)
the mint stripe indented to 1531 while the standard's founding is 1513/1481.

**Fix — 2-rule policy (curator direction), shared by BOTH surfaces.** New helper
`timeline.founding_mint_start(reign_min, dated_min, adoption_year, firm)` →
`(start, approx)`, driving the timeline mint stripe (`derive_mint_overrides`) AND
the phase table (`build._expand_outer_phase_span`, now fed the fuss
`first_adoption` via a cached `_load_fuesse_cached()`):
- **Rule 1 firm** (dated ordinance / curator-certain de-facto start): HARD-clip
  the start to the founding year, no fade. Reign spill before it is cut.
- **Rule 2 non-firm** (uncertain de-facto): start from the reign coin's own year
  WITH the uncertainty fade.

**Discriminator = NEW per-scope field `FussEvent.firm_<scope>` (default True),
read only on `first_adoption`.** Deliberately SEPARATE from `approx_<scope>` (user
choice «окреме поле») so editing the display-approx flag never changes the span
rule. **Keying on FIRMNESS, not literally «has a decree», is what protects the
accepted 9¼-Thaler 1622** — its 1622 is de-facto-but-firm (Friedrich III first
strike, no Møntordning), so `firm=True` hard-clips the 1588 reign coin up to 1622,
no regression. Only `reichsdukatenfuss` `first_adoption.firm_anywhere: false` set
in data (its anywhere 1481/1513 is a genuine de-facto estimate); everything else
defaults firm=True.

**Effect (denmark only):** reichsdukatenfuss/Dukatfod mint 1531→1513 (fade,
clipped at the 1514 timeline left edge so the fade is off-screen — the stripe just
reaches the edge now) + phase I 1514→1513; 8_5_gylden_fod mint 1516→1514 (Rule 1,
Møntordning Sommeren 1514). 9¼-Thaler (1622) + 9-Thaler (1566) + all SH-scope
reichsdukatenfuss UNCHANGED (SH has no Danish Christian II reign coin; its 1591
shift is the pre-existing dated-coin c4h8a expansion). `last_mint` / the phase
to-anchor still exclude reign placeholders — this rule is START-only.

**Scope note.** Only 4 fusses ever had a reign-span-earliest coin (scan:
reichsdukatenfuss, 8_5_gylden_fod, 9_thaler, 9_25_thaler); the helper is a no-op
for every other fuss (no reign coin earlier than its dated coins → dated start).

**Unrelated pre-existing failure noticed:** `tests/test_mint_ambiguity_split.py`
has 4 failing tests (Malmø ø → Malmö ö normalisation in the mint-name splitter) —
confirmed present at clean HEAD before this change (stash-verified). Not caused
here; flagged as a separate task.

## 2026-07-10 — denmark_pre_1541 unification (NumisMaster _pre1541 pipeline retired)

> **UNPUSHED — push pending «пуш».** Commits (newest first): `c760e4f` cache
> pointer bump · `6638351` data re-flow · `c9220e9` code+docs retirement. Plus
> a submodule commit `1b00a12` (cache scope deletion). Working tree clean,
> full build exit 0, preview (port 3000) rebuilt.

**What.** `denmark_pre_1541` was never an entity/location/issuing_entity — only
a legacy NumisMaster harvest **sub-scope** (3 MCs) with its own parser+builder,
which duplicated coins the MAIN sub-scope already covers. Retired it:
- Deleted `scripts/parse_numismaster_pre1541.py` +
  `scripts/maintenance/build_numismaster_pre1541_seed.py` (both generalised long
  ago into the sub-scope-aware `parse_numismaster.py` + merge-aware
  `build_numismaster_seed.py`); dropped `denmark_pre_1541` from
  `parse_numismaster.py` KNOWN_SUB_SCOPES + the `harvest_coverage.py` numismaster loop.
- Removed the 3 `dk-numismaster-167727/167729/167745` seed entries from
  `data/v2/seed/numismaster/royal_holstein.yml` + refreshed its stale §AZ header
  to the §BK main-builder scope_note (dropped `scope_year_from/to` — the pre1541
  fingerprint). Deleted the `scripts/cache/numismaster/denmark_pre_1541/` scope
  (submodule; the 3 MCs live in `schleswig_holstein/` with raw .html + parsed).
- Re-merged + re-absorbed royal_holstein: the 3 unified clusters lost the dk
  member and re-keyed onto the main-scope head (167727 → `unified-dk-numista-309411`
  [+ sh-numismaster-167727]; 167729/167745 → `unified-schleswig_holstein-numismaster-*`).
  All 3 stayed seed_unsorted → 0 curation lost; final 903→903 (exact 3-for-3 re-key,
  verified by id-diff; cross-entity pulls intact; sh-167745 gained Fr 16).

**This ALSO closed the «two-builder overlap» half of systemic follow-up #1**
(NumisMaster ND re-flow): royal_holstein no longer has a main-vs-pre1541 builder
clash — only ONE numismaster builder writes it now. The coordinated re-seed still
needs to review ~3 weeks of builder drift, but no longer has to reconcile two builders.

**LEFT for a user decision (reported in chat).** The **numista** `denmark_pre_1541`
is a DIFFERENT thing and is ALREADY data-unified: `build_numista_seed.py` reads a
flat `scripts/cache/numista/parsed/*.json` dir (not a per-scope bucket) and seeds
those 56 coins to their proper entities — there is NO numista data split. Only dormant
scaffolding remains: `scripts/fetch_numista_pre1541.py` + `scripts/parse_numista_pre1541.py`
+ the raw cache dir `scripts/cache/numista/denmark_pre_1541/` (56 coins, harvest
provenance). Not touched — lower value, higher risk (deleting the raw dir loses
harvest provenance for coins whose parsed sidecars are still consumed). Ask the user
whether to also retire that dormant numista scaffolding.

## 2026-07-09 (later) — Phase-filter fix SHIPPED + reign-span model + coin cleanup

> **UNPUSHED — push pending «пуш».** This session's commits (newest first):
> foundation-reset kmk-158132 · `ca0400e` split 2 over-merges (bruun-14906 +
> kmk-158132) · `24b3297` f3h91 die-error 1633→1653 · `abf915f` year_is_reign_span
> flag · `be01d87` reign-span verified:false (113) · `77df690` Change 2 outer-span
> expansion · `102301d` Change 1 year-filter removal. Working tree clean, build exit 0.

**Phase-filter fix (Part A deferred #1) — DONE, but NOT via the
`_DERIVE_PHASE_FROM_YEAR` generalisation the Part A note guessed.** Final curator
model: **(Change 1)** NO year-filter of coin membership — deleted build.py #6
«year-range sanity» drop + the schema.py chronology validator; a coin lives in its
STORED phase regardless of year. **(Change 2)** `_expand_outer_phase_span` (build.py)
shifts only the TWO OUTER anchors of a fuss (earliest phase year_from/from_label,
latest phase year_to/to_label) outward to cover coins; interior boundaries untouched;
labels auto-generated from coin years. Three guards: `year_verified:false` excluded ·
1914 hard cap (`_MISSION_YEAR_MAX`) · dated-anchor pin (a from/to_label already naming
an explicit year — «30. Mai 1566» — is never overwritten). Self-surfacing: every shift
LOGS its driver coin (⇄ lines). The 4 Haderslev now render on SH.

**Reign-span model — NEW field `Coin.year_is_reign_span`.** A year that IS a ruler's
reign window (placeholder, exact mint year unknown, «1588-1648» Chr.IV) is DISTINCT
from an imprecise estimate («1496-1497»). BOTH are `year_verified:false` (both show
«(?)», both excluded from expansion); the new flag distinguishes them in DATA only (no
render/expansion change). Set by the absorb reign-span override (`_enrich_final_entry`)
when resolved year_ranges == the ruler's reign (`lib.ruler_reigns`) — 159 coins across
danish_realm/royal_holstein/danish_norway/gottorp_duchy. **LIMITATION:**
`normalise_ruler_name` returns None for all NON-Danish rulers, so German dukes/counts
(Ernst III von Gottorp etc.) never get the auto reign-flag — not yet addressed.

**Coin cleanup (drivers the mechanism surfaced):** `f3h91` die-error 1633 (a
NumisMaster-documented «error date for 1653») dropped via _curation_holds; `bruun-14906`
over-merge split (Ernst III Sterbetaler Weinm-153 vs Biblischer Taler Weinm-152, zero
shared index → no_merges); `kmk-158132` over-merge split (4 outliers off the Hede-144
/1629 core via no_merges) + **foundation-reset** (renamed the curated final's id onto
the core `unified-dk-hede-c4h144a` so the 1643 Schou-58 specimen promotes as its own
seed_unsorted final; the foundation-reset trap — a curated final's stored composed_of
re-grabs a split member on the next absorb).

**Whack-a-mole CONVERGED — remaining drivers are legitimate, not errors.** The mechanism
now surfaces `km-44-fr-iii-1655 → 1616` on SH 9_25 — but that is **Frederik III von
GOTTORP** (Duke, reigned 1616-1659; NOT the Danish king), and NumisMaster MC_167284
attests a real 1616 KM-44 «Reuterpfennig». So the 1616 shift is LEGITIMATE, no fix. Twice
this session I mis-read «Frederik III» as the Danish king (§0b) — on this project a bare
«Frederik III» / «Ernst III» is often a Holstein duke/count, NOT the Danish king. OPEN
nuance (not blocking): is a 1616 Gottorp Scheidemünze correctly in 9¼-Thaler-Fuß (label
1622)? — a classification question.

**Change 3 (timeline) — DONE.** The timeline mint-event auto-sync (`📐` log,
`timeline.derive_mint_overrides`) coin-expanded the mint stripe from ALL coins,
ignoring year_verified — so it showed 9_25 mint from 1588 (a reign-span Chr.IV
Skilling) while the phase header, correctly, starts 1622. Added the SAME year_verified
guard Change 2 uses (skip `year_verified: false`); the 1914 cap was already there. The
timeline mint stripe now matches the phase outer-span (9_25 1588→1622, 9_thaler
1559→1566, reichsdukatenfuss[holstein] →1591 Haderslev, 11_333 1700→1725).

**Coin-cleanup tail (all drivers the mechanism surfaced) — FULLY CONVERGED.** The last
SH 9¼-Thaler drivers: km-44 (Gottorp reign-window 1616 → reign-flag), 96114 (stale
source-less 1618 → 1622), bruun-14906/N#278300 (2nd over-merge — Sterbetaler vs
portrait Thaler — split), 120994 (NumisMaster «ND(1618-22)» parser bug → range-start
read as a mint year; corrected to 1622 per Numista N#151529). Only remaining SH shift
= reichsdukatenfuss→1591 (Haderslev, curator-confirmed OK).

**Systemic FOLLOW-UPS (recorded, not done):**
1. **NumisMaster «ND(YYYY-YY)» parser — CODE FIXED, re-flow DEFERRED.** The parser bug
   (reads the range START as a mint year: «ND(1618-22)» → 1618, because the structured
   Date field collapses it AND parse_year_range drops the 2-digit end) is FIXED:
   `parse_numismaster.extract_nd_range()` reads the ND(…) marker + `_complete_abbrev_year()`
   completes the end (raising on a century-boundary rather than guessing), seed builder
   sets `year_verified: false` for `undated` coins. 13 unit tests
   (`tests/test_numismaster_nd_range.py`). Cache re-parsed → 45 ND records fixed
   (submodule commit `8f9b0adaf`; 23 with corrected years incl. MC_101370's 14-year error).
   **NOT re-flowed into seeds/finals** — the numismaster seeds are stale (2026-06-16), so
   a re-seed bundles the 45-coin fix with ~3 weeks of builder drift (scope_note, nominal,
   catalog). (The main-vs-pre1541 two-builder overlap that made this worse was RESOLVED
   2026-07-10 — the pre1541 builder is retired; only one numismaster builder writes
   royal_holstein now.) A surgical ruamel patch reformats the whole file (serialization ≠
   v2_seed_writer). NEXT: a COORDINATED numismaster re-seed (review the full drift +
   reconcile the two builders) materialises the fix into seeds/finals. The one ND coin that
   drove a fuss span (120994) is already fixed by hand.
2. `normalise_ruler_name` returns None for all NON-Danish rulers → German dukes/counts
   never get the auto reign-flag (km-44 marked by hand + kept via _FOUNDATION_IMMUTABLE_FIELDS).
3. N#278300 (Ernst III portrait Thaler) promoted to seed_unsorted after the split — needs
   classification.

## 2026-07-09 — Part A (Bruun mint meta-priority) COMPLETE + crown-map from registry + 2 deferred design decisions

> **UNPUSHED — push pending «пуш».** This session's commits (newest first):
> `8811169` re-merge+re-absorb propagation · `2f1967e` pin curated coins +
> km-645 completeness · `8b531f7` re-seed · `7a647a0` cache pointer (submodule
> `9b0f11246`) · `963a885` parser meta-priority + registry adds · `6cfbf1f`
> crown-map from registry · `afda3b1` year_verified on undated Bruun · `1e6115e`
> drop 3 OOS undated Bruun + NDMED gate. Working tree clean, build + all audits pass.

**Bruun mint meta-priority (Part A) — SHIPPED end-to-end.** Parser now extracts
the mint from the cataloguer's meta-line («… Næstved Mint. …») over the
whole-body MINT_RE search (which grabbed unrelated prose mints). Recovered **203
in-scope mints** (mint=None → correct); dual-mint capture («Altona /
Poppenbüttel», «Malmö or Copenhagen») + `/`-split in `classify_mint_to_entity`.
Registry +5 mints (steinbeck→gottorp, jever→oldenburg, reinfeld→sonderburg,
osnabrueck→osnabrueck, aalborg→danish_realm) + gimsøy alias. Full re-flow
(re-parse → re-seed → merge → absorb): **16 mint-driven re-homings** (14
royal_holstein + 2 bremen_verden) + 1 rescue (Karl XI 1686 Stade Taler). 0
duplicate finals, audit_lost_citations 0.

**Crown-map now sourced from the registry** (`mint_registry._CROWN_OWNED` →
`CROWN_MINT_REALM`/`HOLSTEIN_CROWN_MINTS`, build.py imports them). Added the 6
missing royal-Holstein crown mints (Haderslev/Flensburg/Rendsburg/Rethwisch/
Husum/Poppenbüttel) so danish_realm crown coins there widen onto the SH page.
Fixed the wrong Rethwisch registry comment (Plön until 1761, Copenhagen branch
1769-70, NOT «royal Holstein after 1640»).

**Re-homing PRINCIPLE established: auto-re-home only UNCURATED (seed_unsorted)
lots.** Re-homing a coin already curated in another entity strands its curated
final (absorb keeps it + emits a fresh uncurated one → duplicate + lost
citation). `build_bruun_denmark_seed._ENTITY_PIN` pins the 9 curated Bruun coins
that would have wrongly re-homed (Haderslev Portugaløser 4595/4597/4598/4601;
Rethwisch Speciedaler 7748/7749/7753/7754/10781) back to danish_realm; their
mint still surfaces them on SH via the crown-map render-widening.

**TWO DEFERRED design decisions (both awaiting curator):**
1. **Phase-filter «coins define phase years» — ✅ DONE (see 2026-07-09 (later) entry above; the final model differs from this note's guess).** Curator ruling
   2026-07-09: coins define phase year-boundaries; only the page research-window
   (consumes_window) + location status-changes clip — NOT the phase windows.
   Current `_assemble_v2_location` phase pre-filter DROPS 128 in-scope coins whose
   year falls outside a phase window (condition #6 `year_first outside phase`;
   the 9006 «phase not defined» drops are legit seed_unsorted). Fix = generalise
   `_DERIVE_PHASE_FROM_YEAR` (currently 18_5_thaler only) to all fusses +
   clamp-to-nearest (expand, don't drop). 4 open sub-decisions (in chat
   2026-07-09): clamp-to-nearest confirm · phase DISPLAY-range expand? ·
   status-change exception marker (flag vs consumes-window) · rollout scope.
   This is what still blocks the Haderslev 1591-93 coins from SH (their
   reichsdukatenfuss is phase-blocked by SH Phase-I=1600).
2. **Strict mint→entity for the 9 pinned coins?** They're pinned to danish_realm
   respecting existing curation; to instead honour strict mint→entity, migrate
   each coin's fuss/phase to the mint entity via a classification_decision and
   drop it from `_ENTITY_PIN`.

## 2026-07-02 — km-761 cross-entity consolidation + one-pass relocation + completeness guard (HARD ERROR)

## 2026-06-29 — B4 (9/9) + B5 (1/1) COMPLETE; whole over-union B-group done bar f7h7

> **UNPUSHED** — 41 commits ahead of origin; push pending «пуш».
>
> The 25-group over-union audit is now essentially CLOSED: B1 (8) ✓, B2 (4) ✓,
> B3 (3): f7h16+f7h17 ✓ / **f7h7 deferred**, B4 (9) ✓, B5 (1: f3h153) ✓.
>
> **B4 (9/9)** — all re-evaluated under corrected §9.4 (Sieg sub-variants are
> sub-variants of one coin). 8 merges + 1 clean:
> - c4h106 (`bf8f2df`) Sieg 90.1-90.4; c4h107 (`0a55aa7`) Hede 107 — Sieg 79.3
>   kept as a verified Bruun attestation (c7h25 shape); c9h18+f3h121 (`5f52a41`);
>   f2h20 (`6c1ccf2`) foundation-fold; f5h34 (`d5b12b9`) KM 580/581; f5h38
>   (`2dfca82`) KM 595/596/597 — render exposed a 3rd KM (597) the B4 table missed.
> - **c4h114** (`f430c87`) — the lone CLEAN: kmk-714958 was a Hede-114A specimen
>   mis-DATED 1619 by KMM (reverse reads «16Z0»=1620). Fixed via the established
>   `_KMM_YEAR_ERRATA` map in build_kmk_seed.py (NOT a final note); the year fix
>   auto-re-clustered it from Hede 110 (1619) to Hede 114 (1620-1621). The
>   KMM-year-error practice = that builder map, curator-confirmed per entry.
> - **c7h28/c7h29** (`814a9d7`) — NOT a merge: two distinct «24 Skilling» Chr VII
>   (Hede 28/KM 635/Sieg 17 vs Hede 29/KM 643/Sieg 18, same 9.171 g). The bug was
>   V1 cross-contamination of the KM lists; cleaned both (dropped each other's
>   phantom KM + the orphan NumisMaster source). NO index source-error.
>
> **B5 f3h153** (`f27d6a7`) — «4 Mark Danske» (=1 Krone) Frederik III Glückstadt
> 1659-1660 = Hede 153, Krause-split across TWO volumes. Merged 3 finals with
> **volume-separated dict-form km** `{sh:[95], dk:[A43,B43]}` (KM 95 = German SH
> volume → KM# 95 on SH page; A43/B43 = Danish volume → KM-DK# on denmark) so
> German/Danish indices never conflate. Confirms dict-form km renders correctly
> on BOTH pages for a royal_holstein coin (the c7h13 dict-form glitch does NOT
> recur here). kind set to tarif (§6 Kronemønt).
>
> **OPEN / deferred:**
> - **f7h7 (B3)** — NOT a clean cross-entity dup. danskmoent Hede 7 is a private
>   **Prøvemønt** (pattern, §9.1-excludable); the «km-761» data is actually the
>   f7h6 circulation «2 Rigsdaler» mis-tagged Hede 7. Tangled with f7h6. Awaiting
>   curator decision (fold km-761 into f7h6 + fix Hede tag, or defer).
> - **c9h18 «2 Øre»** — ~29 PRE-EXISTING un-absorbed KMM museum-specimen rows
>   (weightless, fragmented across 19 seed_unified clusters). Separate
>   museum-fragmentation / §9a-thinning issue, project-wide pattern. Not touched.
> - Single-member cross-entity re-home infra (validator relax + xentity stamp
>   fix) was developed for f7h7 then REVERTED when f7h7 deferred — re-add with the
>   concrete use-case if a single-member re-home is needed.

## 2026-06-28 (later) — B2 specimen-fold (4 of 4) COMPLETE + §9.4 rule corrected

> **UNPUSHED** — 30 commits ahead of origin; push pending «пуш». New this pass:
> c7h25 `2773ab2`, §9.4 rule fix `d8df9d7`, B2 c7h39/f4h57/f3h40 `2a1c4d3`.
>
> **B2 «specimen ⊂ main» (4 candidates) all merged.** Each verified via the
> index-graph procedure (build the graph of all catalogue indices across all
> candidates; a unifying catalogue ⇒ one coin):
> - **c7h25** «1 Kurantdaler» Chr VII 1788 — cross-entity merge (royal_holstein↔
>   danish_realm), KM 645 + Hede 25. Sieg diverges by source: danskmoent «Sieg 26»
>   vs Bruun lot 13248 «Sieg-19» — BOTH cache-verified → union `sieg:[19,26]`.
> - **c7h39** «1 Speciedaler» Chr VII 1787-1808 — 5 finals → 1 (KM base 138 sub
>   .1/.2/.3/.5, Hede 39A-39G). Intra royal_holstein.
> - **f4h57** «1 Dukat» Fr IV 1705-1706 — 2 → 1 (KM 2/2.1/2.2, Hede 57A/57B). Intra rh.
> - **f3h40** «¼ Dukat» Fr III 1665+1668 — 2 → 1 (KM 264/264.1/264.2, Hede 40A-40C). Intra danish_realm.
>
> **§9.4 rule corrected (`d8df9d7`).** The old «different catalog index = different
> type» was too blunt — we tripped over it every B-group session. New rule:
> sub-indices (138.1/138.2; 39A/39B; 102.1/102.3) are sub-variants of ONE coin;
> decide same-coin-vs-distinct-type by building the GRAPH of all catalogue indices
> and checking whether ANY catalogue unifies them under one base index. Distinct
> types only when EVERY catalogue gives distinct base indices unified by none.
> Synced the «Do NOT skip» bullet + the anti-pattern §4 fineness clause.
>
> **Remaining B-group fronts (not yet started):** B4 same-KM/diff-Sieg (9),
> B3 cross-entity (3), B5 (1) — per the 2026-06-28 over-union audit below.
>
> **Minor known-quirk — RESOLVED 2026-07-02** (`67590f0` code, `296d051` data):
> the `catalog.hede: '39 C'` whitespace was NOT one occurrence — a full scan found
> **109** of the same Numista tab-split defect (lange 82 + hede 27) across 22 seed/
> seed_unified/final files. Durable fix shipped: `normalise_numeric_index` collapses
> a whole-token «number space sub-letter» via `_strip_subletter_space` (anchored so
> Lange's reign-disamb «358 C IV» + dav volume codes stay intact), reaching the
> render chokepoint + every merge/absorb/seed-writer pass; the 109 existing values
> healed format-preserving (+109/-109, zero churn). test_catalog_subletter_space.

## 2026-06-28 — B1 over-union cleanup (group D / Pattern B), 8 of 8 COMPLETE

> **UNPUSHED** — pushing pending «пуш». New commits this session on top of the
> 2026-06-27 batch: c4h105 `dce7296`, c4h92 `7a7534a`, c5h67+c5h31 `5dfee7e`
> (+ the earlier c4h59 `f2a9291`, pin-heal `f8c2985`, I1-audit `f66e800`).
>
> **Context.** The over-union (Pattern B / group D) audit found 25 danskmoent-page
> collision groups where distinct coins carry each other's Hede sub-letters in
> `catalog.hede`. Sub-categories: B1 distinct-KM (8), B4 same-KM/diff-Sieg (9),
> B2 specimen-fold (4), B3 cross-entity (3), B5 (1). Working through B1 (8) one by
> one on user verdict. Pattern: most are NOT merges — they're genuinely distinct
> types whose catalog.hede over-unioned; a few ARE one Hede type Krause split by KM.
>
> **DONE (committed):**
> - **c4h105** (`dce7296`) — Hede 105 = one «2 Krone» Chr IV; merged KM 60 (105A mit
>   Stern) + KM 61 (105B ohne Stern) into one entity, KM [60,61].
> - **c4h92** (`7a7534a`) — TWO types, not over-union: Hede 92/KM 33 (portrait, Sieg
>   72) vs Hede 77/KM 12 (oval shield, Sieg 71). dk-tid-163044 (KM 12a) was wrongly
>   Hede 92A → re-identified as Hede **77C**, re-homed. merge [dk-bruun-4705,
>   dk-hede-c4h92b, dk-hede-c4h92a] + 5 no_merges (Hede-92A out of KM-12). NB the
>   KM-12 coin now belongs to the **c4h77/Hede-77 family** — a SEPARATE deferred
>   cleanup (Numista 55303 = KM 12/Hede 77,77A 1602-1604 + floating natmus 77A/B/C).
> - **c5h67** (`5dfee7e`) — Hede 67 «1 Krone» Chr V, KM 330(67A)+370(67B) → one row.
> - **c5h31** (`5dfee7e`) — Hede 31 «1 Dukat» Chr V, KM 412+415.1+415.3 → one row.
>
> **Also DONE (committed):**
> - **c5h125** (`7f0bb41`) — «4 Marck Danske» Chr V Glückstadt, six clusters all Hede
>   125 → one entity. Dual-volume KM kept distinct via dict-form km_register
>   `{dk:[77,77.1,77.2,83], sh:[108,110,114]}` (KM-DK# on denmark, KM-SH# on SH; note
>   documents both). Folded km-108/110/114 finals.
>
> **DONE (committed):** c9h1 (`6058712`) — split «2 Christian d'Or» by reign: Chr VIII/KM 722/Hede c8h1 (1841-1847) vs Chr IX/KM 773/Hede c9h1 (1866-1870); ruler fixed (source error danskmoent c9h1.htm desc says Chr 8). NB Chr IX inherits phase I — review.
>
> **REMAINING B1 (2 — complex splits), user-confirmed, plans ready:**
> - **c7h13** «1 Speciedaler» Chr VII 1795-1801 (royal_holstein) — Hede 13 = KM 651 +
>   KM 654 (merge). BUT **Numista 131730 = KM 640 is a DIFFERENT coin (over-merge)**
>   inside the c7h13a cluster — split it OUT to its own row. Split-mixed-cluster shape
>   (no_merge + force-merge, c4h92 pattern).
> - **c9h1** «2 Christian d'Or» (danish_realm) — TWO coins; the Hede-1 clash is because
>   **Hede index restarts per ruler**: Hede 1 = KM 773 (Christian **IX**, 1866-1870)
>   AND Hede 1 = KM 722 (Christian **VIII**, 1841-1847). dk-tid-130240 is over-merged
>   ACROSS both reigns (KM 722 + years 1841-1847 AND 1866-1867). Split into Chr VIII/
>   KM 722 + Chr IX/KM 773 — fix indices AND years AND rulers. **Source error
>   (user-flagged, record in SOURCES §13):** danskmoent c9h1.htm link correctly says
>   Christian 9 but the description text erroneously says Christian 8 — don't let it
>   mis-set the ruler.
> - **c4h119 — DONE** (`38c0275`): split KM 66/Hede 118 (1619) vs KM 67/Hede 119
>   (1619-1623); no_merge+force split the mixed cluster, 6 year_demote stripped the
>   museum reign-span years. [orig plan:] «1 Skilling» Chr IV (danish_realm) — NOT a simple over-union: KM 66 /
>   Hede 118 (1619, oval... portrait) renders as TWO duplicate rows
>   (`unified-dk-hede-c4h118` clean + `unified-dk-hede-c4h119a` messy). Plan
>   (user-confirmed): (1) merge messy c4h119a into clean c4h118 → KM [66,66.1,66.2],
>   Hede [118A,118B], Sieg 31, Schou 142-143, year **1619** (strip the museum
>   reign-span 1588-1648 that came from 5 natmus specimens dated to the whole Chr IV
>   reign); (2) c4h119b (KM 67/Hede 119) keeps 119A-D, fix year_last 1629→**1623**
>   (1629 came from natmus kmk-344187's over-broad date); restore Hede 119A (seed
>   dk-hede-c4h119a) to c4h119b. Same split-mixed-cluster shape as c4h92 (no_merge
>   + force-merge to route the Hede-119 seeds off the KM-66 cluster). The 12 KMM
>   Hede-119 floaters in c4h119a are weightless (no measurement-data loss).
>
> **Reusable pattern for these (proven c4h59/c4h105/c4h92/c5h67/c5h31):** merge_decision
> at seed_unified (durable) → `merge_seeds_cross_source --apply --entity X` → verify

> of the wrong cluster — c4h116 lesson).

## 2026-06-27 — KM-differ candidates closed + dangling composed_of-pin finding

>
> **All KM-differ candidates from the 2026-06-26 list are now resolved + committed:**
> - **c4h116/c4h117** (adeb443) — over-merge regroup: catalog-less KM 80.2 forced into
>   Hede 117 (not 116). Needed the COMPLETE block-set (all 3 catalog-less Hede-116
>   records + kmk-191584 wanderer) because force-merge runs last and auto-match joins
>   catalog-less KM to the wrong cluster first.
> - **c5h57** (48f49ee) — over-merge regroup: Hede 57 (u.år) = KM 455 (1699), not KM 387.
>   Same shape as c4h116; +no_merge [dk-hede-c5h57, denmark-numismaster-65801] to stop
>   KM B445 (1696 horseback Ducat) following the catalog-less record.
> - **c9h16** (21fbdcd) — §CN errata: Bruun KM-195.1 is a misprint of 795.1 (10 Øre),
>   user-guaranteed; fold bruun-8346/8360.
> - **f6h27** (1287d4c) — Krause dual-listing: 1-Rigsbankdaler = ½ Speciedaler ⇒ KM 696.2
>   = 706.2, one coin. Fold + accumulate KM per §9.
> - **c4h59** (f2a9291) — Hede groups ½ Speciedaler Chr IV as one h59 (59A/B=KM 100
>   1624-1634, 59C=KM 135 1646) despite differing KM. merge_decision force + accumulate
>   KM [100,135]; final fold of standalone km-135; note updated (1624-1646, 59C/KM-135).
>
> **FINDING — dangling composed_of pins trip audit_v2 I2 (5 pre-existing; NOT caused
> by today's work).** `audit_v2.py --quick` exits 1 on the worktree AND on HEAD because
> 5 final foundations pin a drop-id in `composed_of` that resolves to neither seed,
> unified, nor final: `dk-tid-70760→unified-dk-bruun-8093` (f6h27),

> `c7h13a→km-651-1` (dedup_final_foundations PAIRS). Root cause: the dedup fold's
> durability pin assumes the drop's twin survives in seed_unified; when a merge_decision
> ALSO merges them at the seed_unified layer (f6h27, c5h57), the twin is consumed → the
> pin dangles AND is redundant (durability already guaranteed by the merge_decision).
> **c4h59 deliberately avoided this** — folded composed_of left clean (`['unified-dk-hede-
> c4h59a','unified-dk-numista-109973']`), no pin, because its merge_decision handles
> durability. The 2 session pins (f6h27/c5h57) are the same easy case and could be
> stripped; the 3 dedup-PAIRS pins need care (no seed_unified merge_decision → check
> whether removing risks absorb resurrection, or whether the pin should target the
> UNIFIED twin id rather than the final id it currently names — the final-id pin may be
> ineffective for durability anyway).
>
> **RESOLVED — all 5 pins healed (`f8c2985`, audit_v2 I2 5→0).** Verified each
> repair against absorb's OWN convergent state (`process_entity`, no `--apply` to

> `unified_by_id` on EVERY run, BEFORE building already_absorbed — so the pin never
> reached the resurrection guard; it was cosmetic. Isolated before/after build diff:
> SH render-neutral; denmark removed 3 latent f6h27 "Bulk-Seed" phantom rows (broken

>
> **I1 home-file audit was STALE — fixed (`f66e800`, audit_v2 --quick 0).** The 39

>   • **3 Portugaløsers KEPT** (387243/387448/427984) — unique FULL-VALUE gold show
>     coins (nominal IS the bullion denomination; «1 Portugaløser» = 10 ducats), could

>   • **468992 EXCLUDED — §9 OFF-NOMINAL** — title «5 Ducats» (pure ducat weight) but
>     value.raw «1 Krone» (KM PnJ16): a 1-Krone struck in 5-ducat gold; same metal (not
>     off-metal) but would NOT circulate at its stamped nominal → out of scope. Standalone,
>     removed from 3 layers.
>   Filter changes: (a) dropped the bare Krause «Pn» trigger (it conflates die-trials
>   with full-value pieces) — keys on TITLE («pattern/trial strike»/«(Pattern)»/off-metal/
>   afslag) + «(OM)» KM; (b) added an OFF-NOMINAL rule (`32e485e`) — title leading segment
>   exactly «N Ducat(s)/Dukat» AND value.raw non-bullion AND «Pn» in KM (the «Pn» gate per
>   user — keeps overweight/tariff/bad-data out). Verified: still catches all 10
>   already-removed strikes; catches exactly 468992 off-nominal; does NOT touch the 181
>   genuine Ducat coins, «¼ Ducat / 3 Mark» tariff coins, or the 3 Portugaløsers.
>   **Class codified as CLAUDE.md §9 item 5 (`b387ab1`)** with all caveats (off-nominal =

>   **(A3) DONE — both diagnoses corrected after deeper research.** `31393` (`6062832`):
>   NOT «strip # → SD 44» — «SIEG SD» is a DISTINCT Saxe-Lauenburg/German Sieg catalogue
>   (numista page confirms; 99 coins use Danish «SIEG#», only this 1 «SIEG SD#»). An old
>   build mis-mapped it into the typed (Danish, reign-scoped) `sieg` field → false
>   collision + mis-render. Dropped the typed dup; citation PRESERVED in `others` as
>   «SIEG SD# 44». `km-x000-fr-iii-1644` lange «280 ff.» (`b2ddeca`): NOT a paper/manual
>   value — a V1-bootstrap over-merge/mis-parse artifact. Per-coin identity audit
>   confirmed it's the SOLE genuine lange mis-attribution (km A43 Frederik III 4 Mark vs
>   the only «Lange 280» in harvest = «280-290» of Johann Adolf 1/16 Thaler KM 5). No
>   harvest source gives this coin a Lange; dropped (coin stays ID'd by KM A43+Hede 153B
>   +Sieg 153.2+Schou+Dav, all corroborated).
>   **Provenance audit (user-requested «what do sources not give»):** (1) vague/malformed
>   scan of ALL typed fields → «280 ff.» was the ONLY one. (2) per-coin identity audit
>   (km-owner match) reliable for GLOBAL catalogues: lange = 1 (this), fr = 0. (3)
>   REIGN-SCOPED catalogues (hede/sieg/schou) can't use km-owner match (numbering restarts
>   per reign → false positives, e.g. documented KM-240/241 Hede-62A) — a reign-scoped
>   (number+ruler→km) pass is an open FOLLOW-UP if we want to close that class. Thinning-
>   salvaged indices trace to dropped-specimen cache records → not flagged.
> - **Table B:** `307035` hede «C4 80.C» (reign-disambiguated, our convention `c4h80.C`)
>   — leave as-is. **6× numista lange «… var.» → STRIPPED (`555f5bd` code, `31d5245`

## 2026-06-25 — night: galster foreign-catalogue reroute + catalogue-hygiene audit (§DA)

> **All UNPUSHED** (this night added 4: `9558e85` docs → `1a03f3e`). `git push` pending.
>
> **Autonomous night work** (user: «лишаю тебе на night work, продовжуй доки не завершиш»).
> Stayed inside guardrails: no push, no new errata beyond curator-approved, ambiguous
> catalogue-semantics DOCUMENTED not guessed.
>
> **Galster foreign-catalogue reroute — FIXED** (`e2e3727` builder, `1a03f3e` data).
> 5 Hans (hg-) Galster coins crammed foreign catalogues into `galster`/`sieg`:
> hg-233/234/236/238 had galster «233, Hildebrand 715, Rasmusson ill. 17,
> Lagerqvist 4» (danskmoent COMMA-JOINS cross-refs into the galster string);
> hg-141 had sieg «Hauberg 102». These rendered as «Galster Lagerqvist 4» on the
> denmark page. `build_galster_denmark_seed._reroute_foreign_catalogue_refs` splits
> on comma + routes foreign-NAME-whitelist parts (Hildebrand/Lagerqvist/Rasmusson/
> Hauberg) to `others`; real index stays typed, legit Sieg «[2015] 8» kept. Applied
> surgically to the danish_realm seed (ruamel round-trip) — NOT via `--no-merge`,
> which had a collateral `mint_verified:true→false` flip on a danish_norway coin.
> Re-flowed danish_realm (merge+absorb, 0 stale dropped); rendered «Lagerqvist 4»
> now a plain `others` entry. Verified end-to-end.
>
> **Broader finding → TODO §DA — CORRECTED 2026-06-25 (§0b).** The whitespace scan
> surfaced 688 values, which I FIRST mis-documented as «~677 need curator judgment».
> On verification (when the user asked me to double-check) that was **~93% false-
> positive**: ~640 are LEGITIMATE source notation — chiefly **569 Davenport
> volume-series** (`dav` «EC II 3529» etc.; numista emits «Dav <series>» codes and
> `numista_canonical.py:99-106` routes them to `dav` BY DESIGN) + 44 spaced
> sub-variants (source's literal «762 b») + 16 year/range/yearbook annotations + 11
> Galster-UU sub-series. The **genuine issues are only ~30**: ucoin `km` «UC# N»
> (12, internal id misfiled), bare-dash empties (6), bruun/galster parser garbage
> (~10), lange «N var.» (6, policy), «; unik» (2). Lesson: «contains whitespace» is
> NOT a bad-index signal (Davenport volumes/sub-letters legitimately have spaces) —
> verify the source mapping before flagging. Full corrected breakdown in TODO §DA.
>
> **2 stale royal_holstein assignments retargeted** (`60b7fcf`). The full re-flow's
> «Curator assignments unmatched: 2» were c4h8b + bruun-14770 — coins that folded
> into heads c4h8a (Ungersk Gylden) / c3h14 (Rhinsk Gylden); the assignments still
> targeted the dead pre-fold ids. Classification was never at risk (curated finals
> are guard-preserved), but retargeted c4h8b→c4h8a / bruun-14770→c3h14 to clear the
> debt. Render-neutral (coin-id set unchanged); unmatched 2→0.

## 2026-06-24 (later) — §9a salvage + galster-key fix + full re-flow shipped

> **All UNPUSHED** (30 ahead of origin; this session added 6: `c199b93`→`9e8b6f7`).
> `git push` pending — no «пуш» yet.
>
> **§9a thinning now SALVAGES dropped specimens' distinguishing data** (`c199b93`
> code+test). Before: thinning a ≥5 bucket to min/middle/max dropped every other
> specimen wholesale, losing any distinct catalogue index (the `others`
> sub-catalogue: schrötter#/olding#/dorfmann#/galster sub-variants) or fineness/
> diameter the reps lacked. Now `_salvage_unique(reps, dropped)` (`lib/seed_thin.py`)
> unions distinct catalogue indices onto reps[0] + fills fineness/diameter only when
> reps lack it; redundant weight + per-specimen sources still shed. Wired into both
> `thin_coins` + `thin_kmk_seed.thin`. 7 unit tests (`tests/test_seed_thin.py`).
>
> **galster-key fix (`66649db` code, `381f35a` seeds; kmk 13819→14003).** The salvage
> exposed a latent bug: the thinning bucket key (`_subvariant_key` in both thinners)
> OMITTED `galster` (a type-identity register, like km/hede/sieg/schou; thin_kmk_seed
> also lacked `lange`). So distinct Galster types (57 Kbh-Søsling vs 63 Malmö-Søsling
> vs 104 ChrIII-4Sk) shared one bucket → collapsed → salvage unioned their galster
> onto one rep → f1g-57 bloated to [5,57,57A,57B,63,104,567B] → 7 transitive
> over-merges. Added galster (+lange) to both keys → over-merge resolved (f1g-57 →
> [57,57A,57B]), +184 distinct Galster types recovered. Verified vs danskmoent:
> f1g57 = «Søsling 1524 København, Galster split into 57A/57B groups».
> Plus two KMM `typeNumber` data fixes in `build_kmk_seed._catalog` (curator-approved):
> galster sub-variant case-norm (57b→57B; scoped to galster — Hede/Lange/Schou case
> convention NOT uniformly uppercase) + builder-level source errata for 3 malformed
> strings (309770 «Galster 5 + B», 311330/311331 «G. 567B» → 57B; f1g5/f1g567 both
> danskmoent-404). Errata in the BUILDER not data-`_source_errata` because these thin
> into the 57B bucket and an entry-level carrier wouldn't survive the next rebuild.
>
> **TOOLING LESSON (merge carry-forward):** when a builder's catalog OUTPUT changes
> (errata/case-norm/key change), a routine `--write` (merge) deep-merges the stale
> on-disk catalog value with the fresh one → list-form bloat (e.g. galster ['5','57B']).
> For a non-curated source (KMK/IKMK) flush with `--write --no-merge` once; then
> routine `--write` is idempotent again. Verified: post-flush `--write` holds 14003,
> 0 bloat.
>
> **denmark UK preamble** (`9df01d6`): «sjælland-ський åbent Brev» (Cyrillic-suffix
> hybrid, §2 trap) → «зеландський відкритий лист» (descriptive, parallel to «норвезький
> ордонанс»). DE/EN keep the Danish proper name. Only the preamble; the 5 other UK
> occurrences already used clean «Sjælland åbent Brev».
>
> **FULL RE-FLOW DONE (`9e8b6f7`)** — merger+absorb all 22 entities, propagating the
> thinning + galster fix to `final/`. Merger 24266 seeds → 15433 unified (8763
> confident folds, 963 conflicts logged to match_uncertainty, no coin loss). Absorb
> final 15152; **522 stale non-curated `seed_unsorted` stubs dropped** (their backing
> specimens were §9a-thinned — EMPIRICALLY verified 0 curated entries in the drop set
> via `_is_vanished_stale_final`'s `not _final_is_curated` guard; curated finals that
> lost backing are RETAINED). Build clean; audit §9a = 0 remaining ≥5 buckets / 0
> same-weight dups. The big line-diff (−82k) is the thinning finally reaching final/.
>
> **Minor open (out of scope, flagged not fixed):** `unified-dk-galster-hg-238` (Hans)
> carries «Lagerqvist 9a-f» in its `catalog.galster` field — a Lagerqvist ref misfiled
> into the galster register. Not touched.
>
> **Pre-existing backlog (NOT from this session):** audit_health shows 588 prose-lint
> errors (§W cleanup) + 1 i18n error — coin-data re-flow doesn't touch prose surfaces.

## 2026-06-24 — V1 layer fully removed; all consumers migrated to V2

> **Commits UNPUSHED** (this session added 9: `366c9f4` reference/ → `30a4718`
> docs). `git push` pending — no «пуш» yet.
>
> **V1 is gone.** V2 (`data/v2/{locations,final}/`) is the sole pipeline. Proven
> empirically before each removal: a full default build is **byte-identical**
> (44 HTML files, manifest sha1 `91357407…038a15`) with vs. without each removed
> piece. What was removed + how:
> - **Empirical proof first**: re-ran ALL 10 V2 seed builders with `data/seed/`
>   moved aside → each reproduced its committed coin-id set 1:1 from cache
>   (`data/seed/` was V1-anchor, not a live input).
> - **kmk-seed «staleness» was a FALSE alarm, now permanently fixed**
>   (investigated 2026-06-24, §0b). The committed seed was never stale — it was
>   deliberately curated: bare builder emits ~41490 raw museum specimens;
>   `822833d` thinned to the §9a envelope, `a80019b` dropped exonumia. The
>   thinning used to be a SEPARATE post-pass (`thin_kmk_seed.py`), so a bare
>   `build_kmk_seed.py --write` regressed it — which is why the last coordinated
>   re-seed (`3486bf0`) skipped kmk. **Fixed `12575db`**: `build_kmk_seed.py`
>   now calls `thin_kmk_seed.thin()` itself (scope→exonumia→§9a in one run,
>   idempotent, `--no-thin` escape). Seed resynced to the builder output
>   (`d547bec`, 13796→13819, render-neutral). **Safe to `--write` now; re-seed =
>   no-op.**
> - **ikmk over-sampling — RESOLVED (full §9a thin)** (2026-06-24): ikmk also
>   over-sampled (4354, biggest bucket 734 uncatalogued «1/24 Taler» 1619; reached
>   final as a 63-weight coin). New shared `lib/seed_thin.py` (§9a min/middle/max,
>   optional `catalogued_only` gate) wired into `build_ikmk_seed.py`. First pass
>   used the catalogued-only gate (→ 4328, only −26 — the 734 uncatalogued bucket
>   stayed); curator then chose the FULL thin (`catalogued_only=False`) since an
>   uncatalogued museum record carries no distinguishing signal beyond the
>   sub-variant key + weight. ikmk seed now **1273** (4354→1273, −3081; the
>   734-bucket → ≤3 per mint-keyed sub-variant). KMK uses its own no-gate
>   `thin_kmk_seed.py` (committed envelope 13819). Both builders self-filtering +
>   content-idempotent (only `generated_at` churns, as for every V2 seed). All
>   render-neutral (data/v2/final/ untouched; resyncs on next coordinated re-flow).
>   The `catalogued_only` gate stays as an opt-in for future uncertain sources.

## 2026-06-23 — 4 mixed cross-source dups merged (c5h56, f2h8, f6h31, f7h8) — durable

> **18 commits UNPUSHED** (this turn added `673bf03`). `git push` pending.
>
> **4 «mixed» dup candidates consolidated** (curator-confirmed by image). Distinct
> from the stale-Hede-orphan pattern — these were fragmented across sources/entities
> at the seed_unified level. Each merged into ONE host with §9a list-form catalog
> accumulation, durable via `merge_decisions` (so a future re-flow reproduces them):
> - **c5h56** Christian V «2 Dukat» Hede 56 → host `unified-dk-hede-c5h56`; km-458
>   (KM 458, Bruun 7243) folded in; KM 416.2/458 accumulate.
> - **f2h8** Frederik II «3 Mark» (≡ 1 Speciedaler) Hede 8/8A/8B → host
>   `unified-dk-hede-f2h8`; manual f2h8b (Hede 8B, Bruun 4422 + Numista 142126) folded.
> - **f6h31** Frederik VI «8 Rigsbankskilling» KM 152 Hede 31 → host
>   `unified-dk-hede-f6h31`; 3 heads united (same Bruun lot 17159); metal silver→**billon**
>   (0.375-fine = billon; fixed at the Hede SEED via `_curation_holds:{metal}` so the
>   merger keeps billon — danskmoent's loose «sølv» was the silver source).
> - **f7h8** Frederik VII «1 Rigsdaler» Rigsmønt 1854-55 KM 760.1/760.2 → CROSS-ENTITY
>   merge (Kopenhagen danish_realm + Altona royal_holstein clusters) into ONE multi-mint
>   `unified-dk-hede-f7h8` in **royal_holstein** (overlap-home per c7h33/c8h11a, renders
>   on both pages); issuing_entity joint `[danish_realm, royal_holstein]`; phase DICT
>   `{denmark: I, schleswig_holstein: III}` (curator). `_cross_entity.yml` pulls the
>   Cph cluster out of danish_realm (no fragment there).
>
> **Method (NEW memory lesson):** these deletions removed finals that fold REAL
> seed-backed heads → seed_unified must be made consistent (else fragments). A full
> `merger+absorb` re-flow does that BUT also materialises every pending decision in the
> entity (surfaced last-session items). Solution: re-flow to compute the hosts, then
> **transplant** only the 4 hosts into a backup-restored committed state, judge by
> **semantic-diff** (`scripts/oneoff/semantic_diff.py`) not the line diff — the line
> churn is YAML-anchor renumbering (cosmetic). Semantic diff confirmed EXACTLY these
> 4 coins changed. Build clean (denmark/SH); f7h8 renders on both pages, f6h31 billon,
> c5h56 dup row gone.
>
> **TWO OPEN FOLLOW-UPS surfaced (not in this commit — need curator calls):**
> 1. **c5h56 host carries KM 346, which is actually Hede 3** (`unified-dk-bruun-6808`
>    «2 Ducats» 1673 — a SEPARATE type). Looks like a pre-existing Hede-3-into-56 leak
>    from an older merge. NOT touched. → remove KM 346 from c5h56?
> 2. **danish_realm has 2 pending fragments** from LAST session's decisions that a
>    future coordinated re-flow WILL surface (a full `merger+absorb danish_realm`
>    materialised them this session, then I transplanted them back to committed):
>    `unified-kmk-301777` «1 Skilling» 1771 (bruun-7774 no_merge → correct separation,
>    seed_unsorted) + `unified-kmk-175833` «3 Skilling» 1812 (f6h14-adjacent, seed_unsorted).
>    Both need classification when the next danish_realm coordinated re-flow lands.

## 2026-06-22 — metal-conflict guard + bruun-7774 metal fix + 4 cross-entity-dup consolidation (durable)

> **9 commits UNPUSHED.** All verified (build + tests + empirical re-flow). `git push` pending.

> When >=2 composed_of members are `metal_verified:True` but disagree on metal,
> the merger/absorb now RAISE `MetalConflictError` (stop → curator decides) —
> it once silently shipped KMM «sølv» over Hede «copper». EXCEPTION: thin-line
> alloy pairs `{silver,billon}` + `{bronze,copper}` WARN + pick by authority
> (bronze IS a copper alloy; museums tag bronze «kobber»). c9h18b «2 Øre» CIX

>
> **bruun-7774 «1 Skilling» 1771 silver→copper** (commit `4a86564`). The guard
> exposed a stale-FINAL bug: the coin was silver but is COPPER (KM 616; ucoin +

> `no_merge` (dk-bruun-7774 ↔ kmk-301777) + metal→copper + drop the stale
> composed_of link. The silver «(?)» group stays a separate seed_unified entry.
>
> **4 cross-entity-id dups consolidated into royal_holstein** (commit `c910fd0`).
> c8h11a / f6h9 / f6h14 / f6h17 each had a stale danish_realm copy + a seed-backed

> **Durability — analysed + PROVEN** (the deletion un-folded 2 KMM specimens that

## 2026-06-17 (later) — CI build fix (ruamel) + Hede discrete-year root fix (c7h13a 1798)

> **CI deploy was RED since ≥2026-06-11 — FIXED (commit `6f787bd`, UNPUSHED).**
> Root: the build path top-level-imports `ruamel.yaml` (via `lib/v2_resolver.py`,
> `lib/seed_merge.py`, `lib/v2_seed_writer.py`) but `requirements.txt` never listed
> it — CI's `pip install -r requirements.txt` lacked it, so every push failed at
> the «Validate data» step (`build.py --validate-only`) with `ModuleNotFoundError`
> before any render. Local `.venv` has ruamel 0.19.1, which masked the gap. Fix:
> added `ruamel.yaml>=0.17`. Verified: full `--include-v1` build + `--validate-only`
> both exit 0 locally. **The push of this WILL turn CI green again.**
>
> **Hede discrete-year root fix + c7h13a 1798 RESOLVED (commits `8571258` code+tests

## 2026-06-16 — overlap-home architecture + merger stage of the global apply DONE; absorb DEFERRED (UNPUSHED, e8de501 + e414a0a + 8d882fe + 1a8097b)

**Architecture fix (the curator's home-file model).** A coin's `issuing_entity`
may be a list (joint mint = circulation in several political entities); the
VALUE keeps the full set, but the HOME FILE must be the overlap entity that
maximises page-coverage. `royal_holstein` is the SH∩Denmark overlap (consumed
by BOTH pages), so a coin with royal_holstein in its IE must home to
`royal_holstein.yml` to render on both via Pass 1 (not the fragile Pass-2
intersection). Shipped:
- `_home_entity` royal_holstein-priority (e8de501) — was `sorted(ie)[0]`
  (alphabetical → danish_realm). Migrated the 7 already-joint misfiled finals
  (6 danish_realm + 1 danish_norway) → royal_holstein; verified 7/7 on both
  pages. **General consumes-map-driven rule (also schauenburg_pinneberg) = TODO §CV.**
- cross-entity stamp derives issuing_entity from MINT, not scalar target
  (e414a0a) — so a joint cross-entity-merged coin keeps joint VALUE + homes to
  the mint-derived overlap entity.
- Re-seed numista (8d882fe) + hede (1a8097b): joint coins re-home to
  royal_holstein. Critically — `_home_entity` is consulted ONLY at the seed
  WRITE step; the merger writes seed_unified + absorb writes final BY
  PROCESSING ENTITY, so raw seeds must re-home first (and a cross-entity
  decision's target_entity IS its home file → KM631 target corrected
  danish_realm→royal_holstein).

**Merger stage DONE (1a8097b), scoped to the Danish trio** (danish_realm,
royal_holstein, danish_norway — all affected members live there). Verified: KM631
→ ONE coin `unified-dk-hede-c7h33a` in royal_holstein (joint VALUE, km
[631,631.1,631.2,631.3], 12 members); Frederik D'or → ONE `unified-dk-hede-f7h1b`
royal_holstein (9 members); fragments absorbed; 0 «absent» warnings.

**Absorb DEFERRED — drift review needed first.** The full re-derive of the trio
surfaced accumulated drift since the 2026-06-09 re-merge. The per-entity
`audit_curation_loss.py` OVER-reports it (a re-homed coin reads as a danish_realm
loss though it's gained in royal_holstein — verified f6h14/f6h17 keep full
catalog+weights there). Genuine items to vet before `absorb --apply`:
- **4 §CU reign-window year-widens** (km-695-4 →1820, f5h24 →1763, danish_norway
  kmk-149434 →1643, kmk-194284 →1648) — same class as bruun-3839/km-795; need
  per-case `_curation_holds` (the year-hold override cebf090 handles them) OR
  the §CU systemic fix. (c4h8a Ungersk 8A+8B→1591-1593 is a LEGIT accumulation,
  not pollution.)
- **catalog/measurement drops** (kmk-149272 hede127; c7h29/c4h68/c5h74 weights/
  fineness) — confirm drift-correction (stale re-grouped-member data) vs §9a
  regression.
- **3 metal flips** (dk-tid-71072/78931/79553 billon→silver; km-358 silver→billon)
  — confirm verified-wins drift-correction vs regression.
**Drift review DONE (2026-06-16) — all ~12 genuine items BENIGN.** Verified per-item:
4 year-widens are legit type-spans/accumulation NOT reign-windows (no §CU holds
needed); catalog drop (kmk-149272 hede127) is stale (no current member attests
it); measure drops are rounding artifacts (c7h29 0.563→0.562) / re-grouped-member
data (c4h68) / §9a thinning (c5h74); metal flips are §4 verified-wins corrections
(billon→silver ×3 via Hede/NumisMaster verified) — and km-358 silver→billon is a
CORRECTION (ucoin mislabelled silver but its own fineness 0.281 = billon). The
per-entity audit over-reported re-homed coins as losses. NO §9a regression, NO §CU
pollution.

**BUT `absorb --apply` (trio) revealed a real CROSS-ENTITY CURATION-MIGRATION gap
— reverted.** When a hede SEED re-homed danish_realm→royal_holstein (the 26-coin
re-seed) but its CURATED final + classification stayed in danish_realm, the absorb
drops the danish_realm final (backing gone) AND bulk-promotes a FRESH royal_holstein
final WITHOUT the curation → fuss/phase LOST (KM631 c7h33a went 11_333_thaler/I →
seed_unsorted; c7h11c vanished). The absorb finals + classification_decisions
pending-regen were `git checkout`-reverted; back to the correct pre-absorb state.

**8 curated re-homed coins need their curation to follow to royal_holstein BEFORE
absorb:** unified-dk-hede-c7h33a/c7h33c/c7h26/c7h28 + dk-tid-79553 (11_333_thaler I),
unified-dk-hede-c7h13a (9_25_thaler III), dk-tid-79166/79168 (9_25_thaler II). Fix
= EITHER add royal_holstein `classification_decisions` assignments {coin_id, fuss,
phase, kind} for each (the bulk-promote then applies them — established mechanism,
but coin_id must match the royal_holstein seed_unified id post-re-home) OR migrate
the 8 finals danish_realm→royal_holstein with ie→joint (like the 7 in e8de501).
The assignment route is cleaner. **This is a focused continuation — do NOT rush at
turn-end.**

### ⚠ APPROACH CORRECTED 2026-06-16 — the assignment route below was TESTED and is INSUFFICIENT; use MIGRATION

**Tested in-session (then reverted):** adding the 7 royal_holstein
`classification_decisions` assignments + `absorb --apply` (trio) gave a PARTIAL,
messy result — only 4 of 7 landed in royal_holstein (c7h33a/c7h26a/c7h11a/c7h11b);
**c7h28 + c7h13a stayed in danish_realm** (their CURATED danish_realm finals are
spared by the stale-final-drop, so they persist there and the rh assignment can't
displace them); **c7h35 + c7h11c vanished** (sub-variant fold). Root cause: the
assignment+bulk-promote route only works when the old curated final is dropped —
but a curated final is SPARED, so it stays in danish_realm and the coin is NOT
re-homed.

**CORRECT route = MIGRATE the curated finals** danish_realm→royal_holstein with
`issuing_entity → [danish_realm, royal_holstein]` (the same surgical move proven
for the original 7 in e8de501, verified 7/7 on both pages), THEN absorb (the
migrated rh final is the foundation the re-homed seed_unified enriches; the dr side
loses backing → stale-drops cleanly). Migrate the danish_realm finals for:
unified-dk-hede-c7h33a (KM631; c7h33c folded in) / c7h26 / c7h28, dk-tid-79553,
unified-dk-hede-c7h13a, dk-tid-79166, dk-tid-79168. **Also:** KM631 (c7h33a)
carries a PRE-EXISTING reign-window year 1766-1808 (member kmk-122886, Hede 33A,
year_verified anchor) — it should be 1778-1785; add a §CU `_curation_holds:
{year_ranges, year_label}` on the migrated KM631 final (year-hold override
cebf090). And confirm the c7h11c/c7h35 sub-variant folds (Hede 11C / 35 — distinct
rows or correct fold?). The fuss/phase/kind VALUES in the block below are still
correct (reuse them for the migrated finals' fields, NOT as assignments):

```

**CAVEATS to check during verify (not blockers, but confirm):**
- **`unified-dk-hede-c7h11c`** (a migrated final, fuss 9_25_thaler) has NO backing in
  royal_holstein seed_unified (the c7h11 seed_unified is a/b/**d**, no c · h11c — it
  folded). On absorb it will consolidate into a c7h11 peer or orphan. CONFIRM whether
  Hede 11C is genuinely a distinct sub-variant that should stay a separate row (then
  it needs its own seed/handling) or correctly folds. The bad-absorb «c7h11c vanished»
  was this fold.
- **km-683/695/721/760/761** (migrated V1-curated finals, no seed backing) are
  orphan-curated → absorb SPARES them (curated, not vanished-stale) → preserved. f6h15
  has backing → preserved. Confirm all 7 migrated finals survive the absorb.

**Sequence:** paste the 7 assignments → `absorb --apply` (danish_realm, royal_holstein,
danish_norway) → `audit_curation_loss.py` (should now show 0 real loss beyond the
benign re-homes) → `build --include-v1` → verify: KM631 → ONE coin
`unified-dk-hede-c7h33a` 11_333_thaler/I royal_holstein on BOTH pages; the 7 c7h/f6
assignments + migrated finals keep their fuss; FrD'or one coin; drop counts don't grow
vs baseline (denmark 7626 / SH 985); spot-check the c7h11c fold → commit. seed_unified
is committed (correct merge, KM631/FrD'or united); finals are at the correct
pre-absorb state. Everything revertible; nothing pushed (31 commits local).

## 2026-06-15 — curation-loss field-diff GATE CLOSED (UNPUSHED, 4b466b2 + fce45f1 + cebf090)

The pre-apply gate is now COMPLETE — supersedes the earlier «verified safe»
caveat in the KM 631 entry below, which only covered entry-DROPS, not
field-level overwrites. New tool `scripts/maintenance/audit_curation_loss.py`
(pure compute via `process_entity`, never writes) diffs the would-be-written
final against the current final on the RE-DERIVED loss-risk fields (year_*,
mint, metal, catalog xsrc, fineness/weight/diameter), skipping
`_curation_holds`-protected fields. Field-category map (from reading
`_enrich_final_entry`): IMMUTABLE (fuss/phase/kind/fraction/nominal/ruler/
mintmaster/issuing_entity) + GAP-FILL (note/verification_note/inscription_*) +
UNION (sources/composed_of) are SAFE; only the RE-DERIVED set can lose curation.

**Full-project result: exactly 2 absorb-stage losses**, both year-widening from
a reign-window composed member — `unified-dk-bruun-3839` (galster-hg-27
1481-1513 v=false widened curated 1497) + `km-795-1-chr-ix-1874` (hede-c9h16a
1863-1906 would back-date the decimal 10 Øre, struck only from 1874). Both
PROTECTED via dict-form `_curation_holds` (curator kept 1497 for bruun-3839).
Everything else benign: 155 Royal-Danish→Kopenhagen mint folds (VERIFIED
against the live Numista source N#18277 = «Royal Danish Mint (Den Kongelige
Mønt), Copenhagen, Denmark (1739-date)» — harvester stored only the institution
name `mints[].name`, registry recovers the city the source states; 121 are
list-form where Kopenhagen is already present from a Hede/Bruun co-member) + 1
benign Malmø→Malmö diacritic (bruun-3839) + 1 year-ADD enrichment. Post-fix
audit: **REAL LOSS widen=0/cat-drop=0/measure-drop=0/metal=0**.

**Mechanism fix shipped (cebf090):** `_curation_holds` on year was INSUFFICIENT
— the held branch did `_union_year_ranges(members)`, folding foundation year
INTO the member union, so it froze only the display label while year_first/last
still leaked to the reign window (and year_first drives §8.2 phase). Changed to
OVERRIDE: a frozen year is authoritative, member ranges don't widen it. Blast
radius 0 (these 2 are the only year-hold entries).

**Deferred systemic follow-up (TODO §CU):** the root cause is `_union_year_ranges`
blindly unioning reign-window placeholder members (year_verified=false full-reign
span like galster-hg-27; OR a loose Hede sub-variant span like c9h16a, v=None)
with tighter same-type attestations. A clean systemic rule (downweight
full-reign-span members when tighter attestations exist) would self-heal future
cases without per-entry holds, but the two pollution signatures differ
(v=false reign-anchor vs v=None loose-range) → needs careful design +
regression testing. Per-case holds suffice for now.

## 2026-06-15 — KM 631 cross-entity merge decision DECLARED (UNPUSHED, 022a754)

KM 631 (2 Skilling, Christian VII, Hede 33 with sub-variants 33A/33B/33C,
struck 1778-1785 at Altona AND Kopenhagen) was fragmented into 3 final rows:
`unified-dk-hede-c7h33a` (Hede 33A, KM 631/631.1, danish_realm) +
`unified-dk-hede-c7h33c` (Hede 33C, KM 631.3, danish_realm) +
`unified-denmark-numismaster-58049` (+ numista N#42563, no Hede, royal_holstein,
seed_unsorted). Split = cross-letter (Hede 33A/C, §9a gate won't unite on RAW
overlap — same class as Frederik D'or) + cross-entity (Altona numismaster/numista
copies bucketed to royal_holstein by mint). Fix = `_cross_entity.yml` force-union
of all 12 seed members, **target_entity: danish_realm** (Danish-realm coinage, Hede
c7h volume); the build's `_derive_issuing_entity` (bd9126b) then renders it joint
[danish_realm, royal_holstein] via the Altona mint → both pages. Pre-scan verified:
9 members home=danish_realm, 3 (numismaster-58048/58049, numista-42563)
home=royal_holstein pulled+excluded. fuss/phase carry from the c7h33a/c7h33c
foundation (11⅓-Thaler I) + their classification_decisions assignments.
**Declarative — materialises on the global merger --apply.** Resolves the
2026-06-14 «single royal_holstein» mis-model flagged in the Royal Danish entry.

**Pre-apply curation-loss gate — VERIFIED SAFE (read-only absorb --dry-run).**
danish_realm/royal_holstein/danish_norway all report «Stale finals dropped (no
backing): 0» → absorb undoes NO curation; curator assignments apply (4+6+0, phase
re-tags survive); net final deltas +22/+4/+1 are legitimate monotonic-guard
re-promote + de-dup reconciliation (current final is behind the pipeline), NOT
loss; 5 enrichment conflicts logged to match_uncertainty (surfaced, not lost). The
km-repr fix survives (seed_unified already clean → absorb reconstructs clean km).
**CAVEAT:** this dry-run reads CURRENT seed_unified, which does NOT yet carry the
KM 631 / Frederik D'or merges — those materialise only after merger --apply. Full
apply effect (new merges + Royal Danish→Kopenhagen rebuild) needs merger --apply
first, then absorb, to be diffable end-to-end. Tree is clean → a verification apply
is fully revertible via `git checkout`.

## 2026-06-15 — issuing_entity derivation for SH-struck crown coins SHIPPED (UNPUSHED, bd9126b)

`build.py::_derive_issuing_entity` (+ `_CROWN_MINT_REALM`): at assembly, a coin
with `issuing_entity == danish_realm` struck at a crown-owned Holstein mint
(Altona/Glückstadt) gets its issuing_entity recomputed as the union of mint-
realms → **Holstein-only strike = royal_holstein; Altona+Kopenhagen = [danish_
realm, royal_holstein]**. Criterion = issuer + circulation, NOT bare mint-
location (curator decision): the issuer-owns-mint guard holds because the crown
owned those mints, and `royal_holstein ⊂ danish_realm` politically so a duchy-
only strike is PURE royal_holstein not joint. Scoped to danish_realm (Pass 1/2
curated only; seed entries untouched) → commission strikes of other issuers at
Altona (Schaumburg-Pinneberg pre-1640, Plön, 1848 Provisional Govt) keep their
own entity. Applied in the two-pass: Pass-2 intersection tests the derived ie
(SH page picks them up) + the resolved coin carries it. Render-only, durable
(absorb's foundation-immutable ie never sees it). Effect: **29 coins (22 joint
+ 7 pure royal_holstein)** now render on BOTH Denmark + SH; km-743 (Copenhagen-
only) stays danish_realm; 1126 Copenhagen-only realm coins unchanged. Verified:
full build clean, ALL per-location drop counts unchanged (no regression).
**Deep-analysis note:** `classify_mint_to_entity` itself encodes the flawed
bare-mint criterion → it would misclassify Altona-struck Danish *seeds* as
royal_holstein; make it issuer-aware (KM register / denomination / ruler) before
the seed-builders become authoritative.

## 2026-06-15 — SH 11⅓ collapse + 18½ per-page phase derivation SHIPPED (UNPUSHED, dc24d7f + fcbf5fe)

Phases are location-local generalisations over a global Müntzfuß (§7); a build
drop fires when a coin's stored scalar `phase` isn't among the consumer page's
windows for that fuss (`build.py:1005-1023`), so cross-periodised coins vanish
from one page. Source review (Wilcke `/wilcke/w3f1.htm`, danskmoent Møntlove)
established the SH 11⅓ sub-phases 1773/1788 are political/institutional, NOT
standard changes (kurant never abolished — «man hang stadig ved Kuranten»;
Altona struck 11⅓ to 1812).

**SHIPPED (dc24d7f):** SH `phases.11_333_thaler` collapsed 3→1 `I[1726-1813]`
(matches DK); 6 coins re-tagged phase II→I (direct final edits + durable
`classification_decisions` assignments); the «retired/only-until-1788» claim
corrected on every surface (SH closing/timeline + DK phases/timeline/
fuss_periods) → Speciedaler became Holstein's PRIMARY from 1788 but the kurant
itself continued; refs_pool gained `wilcke-1788-speciebank-kurant` +
`sh-speciesbank-1788`. Build: drops DECREASED (denmark 7652→7646, SH 991→986),
citations resolve, no stale claims.

**SHIPPED — 18½-Thaler via per-page phase derivation (commit fcbf5fe, option b).**
The first-tried «add 1841/1854 phases to DK» was BROKEN (narrowing DK's single
phase I[1813-1875] dropped its phase-I coins with years 1842+, +52 regression,
proven by build → reverted). The fix is build-side: `build.py`
`_DERIVE_PHASE_FROM_YEAR = {"18_5_thaler"}` — for that fuss the assembly COMPUTES
each coin's phase per consumer page from `year_first` against THAT page's
windows (stored phase wins only as a boundary tiebreaker). No phase-window
edits, no coin re-tag, denmark.yml untouched. On the Denmark page 18½ keeps its
single wide I[1813-1875] so every 18½ coin (incl. SH-periodised stored-II/III
dual-mint coins) derives to I and renders; on the SH page each derives to its
finer I/II/III/IV year-window. Verified: full V2 build clean; drops decreased
(denmark 7646→7626, SH 986→985) and unchanged on every other location; km-721/
760/761/683 render on BOTH pages.

**Other granularity desyncs — widen `_DERIVE_PHASE_FROM_YEAR` per fuss after
review:** 9¼, 9-Thaler, kronemont, reichsdukatenfuss, courantdukatenfuss,
guldkrone, kronemont_chr_iv all have differing DK↔SH windows; adding each fuss
key to the set resolves it the same way. Do a quick per-fuss «realm-wide law vs
political event» sanity check + a build-drop diff before widening (deliberate,
not blanket). The 2 refs `danskmoent-moentlove-1841` +
`forordning-rigsdaler-rigsmont-1854` were prepared then removed — not needed by
the derivation approach (no DK phase prose added); re-add only if the DK 18½
prose is later expanded.

## 2026-06-14 — KM render-leak fix + two pipeline fixes staged for the coordinated apply (UNPUSHED)

10 commits unpushed (origin/main..HEAD). This session, in order of the user's reports:

1. **KM str-repr corruption — FIXED + applied (commit 38f4f67).** 6 V2 final
   entries carried a `catalog.km` list whose first element was a Python
   str-repr of the real KMRef-list (`"['63', {'value':'103','register':'DK'}]"`),
   a leftover from the 2026-05-31 «44-false-positive» `str(km_list)` bug
   (the write path is long fixed; only the baked data remained). Repaired via
   `scripts/maintenance/fix_corrupted_km_repr.py` (faithful explode+dedup, no
   register re-adjudication). Trigger coin c5h121 now renders «KM-DK# 103 ‖
   KM-SH# 63». seed_unified was already clean; only final changed. Verified:
   0 leaks across schleswig_holstein + denmark, 3 langs.

2. **2 Frederik D'or Hede 1B+1C merge — DECLARED, NOT applied (commit 17b4e69).**
   User: «це одна монета». Diagnosed (empirically via `match_pair`): the
   auto-matcher's §9a `_has_type_strong_agreement` gate uses RAW catalog
   overlap, so sub-variants (Hede 1B vs 1C, KM 750.2 vs 750.3) don't overlap →
   pair drops to low_confidence → never unites. Mint was NOT the blocker
   (both carry Altona). Same cross-letter class as Ungersk Gylden 8A/8B.
   Fix = per-entity `merge_decisions/royal_holstein.yml::merges` (9 source
   seeds). Dry-run preview confirms one unified entry, no catalog conflicts.
   Takes effect on the next merger+absorb apply.

3. **Numista «Royal Danish» mint — registry fix DORMANT, NOT propagated (commit c9d9f8d).**
   «Royal Danish» = «Royal Danish Mint» (Den Kongelige Mønt) = Kopenhagen,
   verified via Numista cache (`mints[].name`, `mint_text`). The seed writer's
   « Mint»-strip reduced the API name to «Royal Danish», absent from the
   registry → surfaced as a bogus mint on 418 V2 entries (all sourced from
   numista). Fixed at the single source of truth: added «royal danish» +
   «royal danish mint» to the kopenhagen alias set in `mint_registry.py`.
   Dormant for render (build reads final mint as-is). User chose to defer
   propagation to the coordinated apply. **At apply:** the 24 numista seeds
   carrying `['Altona','Royal Danish']` become `['Altona','Kopenhagen']` →
   `classify_mint_to_entity` returns `[danish_realm, royal_holstein]` (multi)
   instead of scalar `royal_holstein`. **KEEP this — do NOT drop Copenhagen.**
   §0b CORRECTION (2026-06-15): an earlier caveat here hypothesised the
   Copenhagen was a «spurious Numista guess» to authority-drop. That was a
   hypothesis-as-conclusion and was REFUTED on verification: for 19 of the 24,
   Copenhagen is independently confirmed by Bruun and/or NumisMaster (and Hede
   for KM 631) — they split the KM sub-variants by mint (.1=Kopenhagen,
   .2=Altona, etc.). These are GENUINE multi-mint Altona+Copenhagen types, so
   the `[danish_realm, royal_holstein]` joint classification is CORRECT (they
   render natively on both pages). The other 5 (KM 600/651/767/763/958) have no
   independent corroboration but no refutation either → keep per §0b. NOTE: KM
   631 is therefore a genuine joint coin — the «single royal_holstein, denmark
   consumes it» modeling chosen on 2026-06-14 was under the wrong premise;
   joint `[danish_realm, royal_holstein]` is the accurate model (pending user
   confirmation).

**→ The «coordinated full apply» now bundles 3 things** (all gated on the
curation-loss audit, TODO #6 / parked task #4-#8): (a) Ungersk Gylden
cross-entity merge (commit 431a18b, `_cross_entity.yml`); (b) Frederik D'or
merge (17b4e69); (c) Royal Danish seed-rebuild (re-run `build_numista_seed.py`
from cache — NO live API — then merger+absorb). Sequence: curation audit →
re-run numista seed-builder → full merger `--apply` (no `--entity`, so the
cross-entity source-side excludes apply) → absorb dry-run gate → absorb
`--apply` → build `--include-v1` → verify. The merger/absorb REBUILD fresh
from members, so stale «Royal Danish» is replaced (not appended) once the
seed source is fixed — addresses the «additive-only» concern.

## Denmark gold-gylden Rhinsk/Ungersk reclassification — SHIPPED 2026-06-12, UNPUSHED (commit 682e5e5 + d4d7e3a + eefddf5)

Discriminator between `rhinsk_gylden_fod` (Rhenish gylden, .75 / 18 Karat /
72 per Cölln. mark — **academic source: Wilcke 1950 w7-2 p.184 «Rinske
Gylden (18 Karat, 72 Stkr.)»**, ref `wilcke-rhinsk-gylden-1524-standard`) and
`reichsdukatenfuss` (Ungersk/Dukat, .986) is FINENESS, not weight. Numista's
generic "Goldgulden" label hides this → systematic misrouting. danskmoent/
Galster classify each coin (Galster 27 = Rhinsk; Galster 46 / c2g-89 =
Ungersk). Fixed so far:
- Frederik I 1527 (Galster 59) → rhinsk_gylden_fod (commit eefddf5).
- Hans ~1497 N#355730 (Galster 27, danskmoent hg27 «den ældste i
  Skandinavien») → rhinsk_gylden_fod; now the EARLIEST Danish Rhinsk Gylden
  (commit 682e5e5). reichsdukatenfuss de-facto anchor corrected 1481→1513
  (Christian II Ungersk Galster c2g-89, already on the fuss) — the old prose
  wrongly used the Hans Rhinsk coin as the .986 anchor.

**OPEN follow-up (flagged, not done): ~58 seed_unsorted gold gylden/dukat
coins** on danish_realm carry the same Numista-"Goldgulden" ambiguity (e.g.
f2h7e Ungersk / f2h7g Rhinsk 1584, kmk-137161/2 Ungersk 1592, kmk-575432
Frederik I 1531 Ungersk). A Rhinsk-vs-Ungersk classify sweep by
danskmoent/Galster fineness is the next batch task. Mechanism reminder: a
coin only renders on its bar if `phase` is defined for that fuss AND
year_first is within the phase year-envelope (±1) — extend the phase/bar
year_from when a coin predates it (build.py:1005-1023). Duplicates across
sources merge via `promoted_to` + `composed_of` (Pass 1 skips promoted).

## Fuss cross-reference system — SHIPPED 2026-06-11, UNPUSHED (commit 451d0f0; TODO §CT closed)

Prose references a Müntzfuß by stable id now — `[fuss:KEY]` — not a
hand-written `<code>Name</code>` span. Post-render resolver
`scripts/lib/fuss_refs.py::process_html(html, lang, name_map)` (mirrors
`refs_pool`, called at both build.py post-render sites) substitutes the
EFFECTIVE name (per-location `fuss_periods[KEY].name` override layered
over global `fuesse[KEY].name`) and links to `#fuss-KEY` when that card
is on the page (plain `<code>` otherwise; unknown key → visible §0
placeholder). build_landing gained a `fuesse` param for the global-name
map. Migration `scripts/maintenance/migrate_fuss_xrefs.py` (idempotent)
converted 168 refs across fuesse.yml + V1/V2 location yamls. Tests
`tests/test_fuss_refs.py` 7/7. Payoff proven in render: same
`[fuss:reichsdukatenfuss]` → «Rigsdukatfod» (linked) on Denmark,
«Reichsdukatenfuß» (plain) on Hamburg. Cross-PAGE linking deferred (would
need a key→owning-location map). Full spec + as-built:
`docs/fuss_cross_refs_design.md`. **Next:** if a new fuss is referenced
in prose, just write `[fuss:newkey]` — no name, no `<code>`. Optional
follow-up noted in design doc: an `audit_prose.py` rule flagging NEW
hand-written `<code>fuss-name</code>` spans to stop the convention
eroding.

Also this session (2026-06-11), earlier commits 4a86665 / 8428c9f /
627c4a8: Nobel/Rosenobel prose polish — UK «сучасн-»→«тогочасн-» where
period-relative; rosenobel «contemporary→earlier nobel_fod» factual fix;
«Reichsdukat»→«Dukat» (Danish coin name) in the Nobelfod description.

## KMM impossible-year guard — galster-hg-31 1581 fixed (2026-06-11) — SHIPPED, UNPUSHED (4 commits: d5eea8e/bc4a341 then revised fbc926c/d73819c)

Closes the kmk-297794 «1513-1581» quirk surfaced by the Hans Galster-volume
session. Root cause: 25 KMM (natmus) records carry a `creationEvent` with
`yearFrom > yearTo` (raw inversion). The old `build_kmk_seed._year` only
swapped, so an impossible value survived (Hans hvid 1581/1513 → 1513-1581;
1581 is 68y after Hans †1513). New guard: swap when the implied span ≤ 20y
(ordering slip — 7 records, all within reign), else DROP the event's year
(year=None — 18 records, all impossible: truncated yearTo 152/58/675/…,
post-reign yearFrom). Builder fix `d5eea8e`; data `bc4a341`.

- **Materialised** by patching the in-seed records' year fields directly
  (full `build_kmk_seed` re-run RE-INFLATES — thinning is a separate step;
  danish_realm dry-run shows 32215 vs thinned 9630, so DON'T full-rebuild
  to materialise a few rows — patch the thinned seed with the canonical
  ruamel config `typ=rt, preserve_quotes, width=200, indent(2,4,2)` or the
  whole file reformats) → re-merge + re-absorb danish_realm + danish_norway.
  galster-hg-31 1 Hvid Hans now reads 1481-1513; page has 0 year-«1581».
- **REVISED — null → reign-window anchor (`fbc926c` + `d73819c`).** The first
  approach NULLED the year on dropped events. That removed the coin's ONLY
  merger fallback signal, so 6 same-type museum specimens (Christian-IV
  Hede-67 2-Skilling etc.) that share a type-level catalogue but carry no
  fineness/mint stopped merging and surfaced as standalone seed_unsorted
  finals — a regression. Fix: a dropped-all-year record now anchors to the
  named ruler's reign window via `lib.ruler_reigns.reign_window`
  (year_verified=False) — plausible-but-estimated, so the §9a multi-specimen
  merge fires again without the garbage value. 191584 now re-merges into a
  4-member Christian-IV group (year 1588-1648 unverified). Bare-«Hans»
  (no ordinal) doesn't resolve a reign → stays year-None, harmless (merges
  via Galster).
- **❌ CORRECTED — the «KMM Arabic-vs-Roman ruler-scope gap» I flagged here
  earlier DOES NOT EXIST.** I asserted it WITHOUT verifying (§0b lapse).
  `merge_seeds_cross_source._normalise_ruler` ALREADY folds Arabic↔Roman:
  `_normalise_ruler("Christian 4") == _normalise_ruler("Christian IV.") ==
  "christian iv"` → same scope key. The real reason those specimens stood
  alone was the year-null regression above (matcher requires primary +
  ≥1 fallback; nulling the year left primary_true=4 / fallback=0 →
  «insufficient signals» → no_match). Now fixed by the reign-window anchor.
  NB: they still don't merge with the CURATED `c4h67` — but that's a genuine
  metal disagreement (KMM silver vs curated billon), correctly blocked.

## Numista discrete-year (year_list) harvest gap — 501 re-harvested (2026-06-10) — SHIPPED, 3 main + 1 submodule UNPUSHED

User noticed Numista DOES give discrete struck years (1496, 1502) — in the
«Manage my collection» date table — but our data showed the continuous
range «1496-1502». Diagnosed: loss is at the HARVEST step, not the parser.
The thin BO.1/chrome extractor (HARVEST_GUIDE) read only the «Years» range
feature, never the `table.collection` date column, so 501 in-scope
multi-year types had `year_first/last` but `year_list: null` →
`build_numista_seed` fell back to a continuous `year_ranges`. The whole
downstream was already discrete-ready (`parse_numista_chrome` consumes
`year_list`; seed builder emits `[[y,y]]`; merger's `_union_year_ranges`
prefers discretes). The v3 API does NOT help (`parse_numista_api` hardcodes
`year_list=null`; discrete list needs the un-fetched `/types/{id}/issues`).

- **Harvest (`submodule 93b0460d`, cache pointer `<bumped>`):** re-harvested
  all 501 via Chrome MCP same-origin `fetch()` + DOMParser of
  `table.collection` (≈30 NIDs/JS-call, 0.3 s pacing, 0 Cloudflare 403s).
  **417 gained discrete years, 84 confirmed range-only** (kept, NOT
  fabricated). year_list written to raw cache + parsed sidecars.
- **HARVEST_GUIDE extractor upgraded** (`docs`) to capture `year_list` from
  the date table — durable fix so future harvests + re-harvests get it.
- **Materialised (`012fb9e`):** re-parse (surgical — deleted only the 501
  sidecars, re-parsed WITHOUT --force to avoid surfacing 575 unrelated
  newly-parseable types) → re-merge + re-absorb. **412 propagated** into
  rendered finals across danish_norway + bremen_verden + oldenburg +
  braunschweig_lueneburg + sachsen_lauenburg + osnabrueck (gapped labels
  render). danish_norway −3 = lossless Hans-1-Hvid consolidation (the
  prior Galster-volume fix reaching this entity; seed 3903/3903).
- **Residual (entity-routing backlog, NOT this task):** 5 hanseatic_lubeck
  + 144 `_unclassified`-final coins whose numista seed routes to
  `_unclassified` (≠ their foundation's entity) — year_list is in cache +
  `_unclassified` seed, propagates once they're classified. See SOURCES §13.1.
- **Method gotcha for next time:** `parse_numista.py --force` re-parses the
  WHOLE cache and surfaces newly-parseable types (575 → _unclassified, +

## Hans Galster volume-scope fix — 1 Nobel year + 31 split-dup consolidations (2026-06-10) — SHIPPED, 2 main UNPUSHED

User flagged: 1 Nobel Hans (Galster 24) rendered «1496-1502» (continuous)
but sources attest discrete 1496 + 1502. Root cause was a **cross-source
matcher gap**, not the year-merge rule (`_union_year_ranges` is correct):
the coin was SPLIT across two finals — `unified-dk-bruun-3831`
(Bruun+Numista+KMM; Numista's loose min/max `[[1496,1502]]` drove the
year) and `unified-dk-galster-hg-24` (discrete `[[1496,1496],[1502,1502]]`).
They never merged because `_catalog_refs` derives the Galster volume-scope
from the ruler via a regex requiring a NUMERAL — **Hans has no ordinal**,
so his refs stayed bare `galster` while the Galster-source entry sat in
`galster/hg`; same Galster 24 → no catalog tie → `no_match`.

- **Fix (`a37c821`):** make the ordinal optional in the volume-derivation
  regex; map no-ordinal Hans → `hg`. Now bruun/kmk/numista Hans galster
  refs scope to `/hg` and merge with Galster-source entries.
- **Data (`bc6dc40`):** re-merge + re-absorb. 1 Nobel now ONE entry,
  `year_label '1496, 1502'` (discrete wins — period not wider than
  discrete min-max), galster source + Galster 24 + schou 2,3 all unified.
  68 Hans bare-galster seed refs re-scoped; **31 stale Hans foundations
  consolidated into peers** (1 Nobel/24, 1 Skilling/29, Goldgulden/27,
  1 Hvid/31 +17 KMM specimens, …) — all same-galster-number same-type
  (verified: every galster-31 member is Hans 1 Hvid; 0 wrong-ruler merge;
  seed conservation 12819/12819, 0 loss).
- **Surfaced (NOT fixed — pre-existing KMM quirk):** `kmk-297794` (Hans
  1 Hvid, Galster 31) carries a loose KMM date «1513-1581», so the
  consolidated `unified-dk-galster-hg-31` year_label widened to
  «1481-1581» (1581 ≫ Hans †1513). A KMM date-field error on one
  specimen, not a merge defect. Candidate for a KMM date-sanity pass.

## Galster single-coin overview-page recovery: 2/3 Nobel danskmoent source (2026-06-10) — SHIPPED, 3 main + 1 submodule UNPUSHED

User flagged that the danskmoent.dk source on **2 Nobel** (Hans 1502,
N#428886) + **3 Nobel** (Hans 1496, N#428914) had vanished. Root cause:
the Galster classifier (`scripts/lib/galster_parsers/classify.py` rule 3)
routes any non-per-coin-filename page to the `reign_index` skip-parser as
a redundant overview. `1nobel.htm` IS a genuine multi-reign overview, but
`2nobel.htm` / `3nobel.htm` are **single-coin pages** (one catalogued
type each → danskmoent never split a dedicated per-coin page), so they
were silently dropped from the seed and never reached the coins.

- **Fix (`c63779a`):** conservative content-based carve-out in rule 3 —
  ruler-keyword H1 + exactly one Galster number + no overview markers
  («Se også» / «ser således ud» / «Møntrækken» / reign-range header)
  → route to `standard`. Dry-run over all 171 reign_index pages: exactly
  4 flip (2nobel, 3nobel, 6penning, halvrhin), all genuine single-coin;
  167 true overviews untouched. Also extended the galster year regex
  `1[5-6]→1[4-6]` (standard.py + build_galster) so Hans-era 14xx years
  parse — 3nobel's 1496 was being dropped (→ no seed). Blast radius:
  only fr_hg24 (1 Nobel Hans) gains its genuine 1496 year. `_build_sources`
  now falls back to catalog_refs.galster + omits empty volume parenthetical.
- **Data (`99a1c69` + cache `bbad3177`):** re-parse → galster seed (+2
  entries) → merge danish_realm → absorb. 2 Nobel gains catalog galster 26
  + danskmoent/2nobel.htm; 3 Nobel gains schou 1 + danskmoent/3nobel.htm +
  mint union [Kopenhagen, Malmö]. Both render on the Denmark page (verified).
- **6penning** (Erik af Pommern, Åbo, pre-1481) + **halvrhin** (Hans ½
  Rhinsk gylden, u.år) re-parse as single-coin but stay out of seed scope
  (undated, no reign-volume anchor → builder drops them).
- **Forgery-year drop (`3deea9d` + cache `afc092d`, data `e080583`).** Hans
  1 Nobel (fr_hg24) carried 1508 — danskmoent flags «(1508 er falsk)»
  (the only 1508-dated specimen is a forgery). Fixed via PARSER, not
  errata (the source is correct, the parser mis-read it; errata is for
  catalogue-index corrections). `_FORGERY_YEAR_PAREN_RE` strips a paren
  with year+falsk before year extraction; cache-wide only `(1508 er falsk)`
  matches → only fr_hg24 affected. year_label 1496,1502,1508 → 1496,1502.

## Source-quality + Schauenburg entity split (2026-06-10) — SHIPPED, all local/UNPUSHED (`git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD` for the live count)

Six discrete tasks this session, all committed locally, **0 pushed** (push
needs explicit user OK). Pre-commit hook + V2 build clean throughout.

**(1) Bruun nominal-normalization restored — `f252733` (code) + `7f54d64` (data).**
The Bruun seed builder had lost its display-nominal layer: fresh entries went
in raw (no implicit-«1», roman not converted, fraction glyphs, NAME-parens,
ø-spelling) while 1099 existing entries carried normalized forms — a naive
re-run would degrade all of them. Added `_bruun_display_nominal()` +
`extra_curated_fields=frozenset({"nominal"})` threaded through
`merge_one`/`merge_seed`/`write_v2_seed` (default empty → no-op for other
builders) so existing nominals are soft-preserved, fresh ones normalized.
**parse_metal now runs on the RAW denomination** (parens intact) BEFORE the
display strip — the descriptive paren carries the metal signal («12 Mark
(Courant Ducat)»→gold, «8 Skilling (klippe)»→silver); running it on the
stripped nominal had regressed 3 metals. Proven 0 semantic diff on re-run.
`7f54d64` re-serialized the last PyYAML-style bruun seed (danish_realm) to
ruamel — corpus format consistency.

**(2) Absorb drops finals whose backing vanished — `78d54f2` (code+test) +
`340219a` (data, −17).** Absorb was additive/sticky: a final persisted even
when its backing seed_unified entry disappeared (the 622-exonumia hand-removal
case). New drop: a `unified-*` final with NO live backing AND no curation
(fuss seed_unsorted/None, no note/_curation_holds/promoted_to/curator-phase)
is dropped — two enforcement points (explicit filter on the new final set +
monotonic-guard exclusion so a final dropped by an earlier purge isn't
resurrected). Module-level `_final_is_curated`/`_final_has_live_backing`/
`_is_vanished_stale_final` + 19-case unit test (`tests/test_absorb_stale_final_drop.py`).
Materialized 17 drops (15 cross-source-consolidation dups + 2 sub-variant
re-key dups: dk-hede-f3h135→f3h135a/b, dk-galster-f1g-66→f1g-66c); verified 0
seed orphaned, 0 cross-entity dup, note preserved.

**(3) Re-serialize remaining stale seeds — `fe6574c`.** 5 seed files still in
old PyYAML dash-at-parent style (3 kmk + 2 numismaster) → ruamel round-trip,
0 semantic diff. Pure format (a builder re-run was wrong: kmk writes 0 files
without parse-cache, numismaster re-run is a real data change). Corpus now
uniformly ruamel.

**(4) NGC grade-colour → copper — `ec63ace` (code) + `9720042` (data).**
parse_metal reads the NGC/PCGS colour suffix (Brown/BN/RB/RD, anchored to
«NGC <grade> <colour>» so prose «brown patina» never false-matches) →
("copper", False), placed after explicit metal-words, before the weak
denom heuristics. 24 in-scope flips (Danish bronze Øre, copper Rigsbanktegn,
small Rigsbankskilling, 1677 siege klippe dk-bruun-7277, 1602 copper Penny).
Knock-on: corrected metal unblocked 5 cross-source merges (Bruun KM-entry ↔
Numista N#-entry, e.g. KM-754=N#43524) — verified 0 loss, 0 dup.

**(5) Schauenburg 2-entity split — `997aa83`.** The old
`holstein_schauenburg_county` umbrella conflated two regional traditions →
split into **`grafschaft_schaumburg`** (Niedersachsen, 36 coins —
Stadthagen/Bückeburg/Oldendorf/Rinteln, Mariengroschen tradition) +
**`schauenburg_pinneberg`** (Holstein, 246 — Altona, SH-Courant + imperial
1/24). holstein_schauenburg page consumes BOTH; schleswig_holstein consumes
only the Holstein half (mirrors royal_holstein-on-denmark). Mechanism:
new entity in issuing_entities; mint_registry (4 NS mints→grafschaft;
Schauenburg issuer-name fallback→pinneberg); routing-rule routes_to
grafschaft; **`build_numismaster_seed` now applies route_entity_with_rules**
(was the 6-coin mis-route bug); bruun meta-tag→pinneberg. 123 county finals
migrated verbatim (ids+notes preserved) then merge+absorb reconciled;
test_entity_routing 10 green. See V2_DECISIONS D45 (+ D44 for the absorb drop).

**(6) numista dav-dedup refresh — `b7b2165` (9 entities).** Re-running
build_numista_seed materialized a stale catalog.dav: a 2-elem list with the
SAME Davenport ref in two formats («EC II# 3656»+«EC II 3656») → scalar.
218 entries, 0 other field changed. Seed-layer hygiene only — rendered final
was already clean (absorb's `_fold_catalog_indices` normalizes on accumulate).
numista-only quirk; ikmk/numismaster/bruun verified 0 non-Schauenburg drift.

**CLOSED later in the session (the deferred clean-up, all committed):**
- ✅ **galster 66A/66B genuinely lost — recovered** (`1b9e479` fix + `4c170ca`
  data). NOT a re-key: 66A-B (pre-coronation Electus variant) ≠ 66C. Cause:
  the `seed_merge` supersession-drop keyed on id-STRING and dropped
  `dk-galster-f1g-66` (catalog «66A-B») as if `…-66c` superseded it. Fixed
  catalogue-aware (`_own_cat_has_subletter`). Full re-run of hede+galster
  found NO other dropped sub-variants — blast radius was exactly this 1 coin.
- ✅ **holstein_schauenburg page prose rewritten** (`388e6bb`). Summary →
  historical two-part principality (drop «104-piece pending / IKMK
  undistinguished»); phase prose cleaned of §0z project-meta (source
  file-paths / «Build-Assembly» / «Bulk-Seed» pipeline labels); §2-clean,
  renders both parts.
- ✅ **audits run** — `audit_prose` / `audit_i18n` on the new prose
  (grafschaft_schaumburg desc + rewritten summary/phases): 0 new violations,
  i18n-clean.
- ✅ **SOURCES §13.1** numista EC II# quirk (`9b9d413`); **memory
  tooling_lessons** scoping-bug entry (config-dir auto-revert).

**OPEN / next:**
- 🟡 **Systemic §2 «Taler» → «Thaler» normalisation (curator decision).**
  Project-wide: ~1000+ `nominal: … Taler` (178 «1 Taler», 857 «1/24 Taler»,
  …) + 657 §2 note-prose errors (`audit_prose` backlog). The nominal field
  uses «Taler» pervasively while §2 wants «Thaler» in DE prose — the audit
  flags notes, not nominals. NOT introduced by recent work; needs a deliberate
  project-wide pass (nominals + notes together) or an explicit «keep Taler in
  nominals» convention. The 1 holstein_schauenburg `audit_prose` hit
  (unified-dk-bruun-14913 note) is one instance, left as-is pending this call.
- 🟢 Pre-existing standing TODOs untouched: schou-only (17) catalog-noise;
  ~8 genuine catalog over-merges.

## composed_of re-validate + full re-merge (2026-06-09) — SHIPPED, 3 commits UNPUSHED

The absorb stage is additive + STICKY: once a unified entry lands in a
foundation's `composed_of`, no later run re-checked whether it still
belonged. Earlier mis-groupings (and V1-bootstrap composed_of carried
forward) persisted forever — KM 42 «8 Skilling» (`dk-tid-163034`) had
dragged in «1 Denning» (0.44 g) + «4 Skilling lybsk» (1.822 g) + two
«6 Skilling», polluting the 8-Skilling weight envelope.

**(A) `_revalidate_composed_of` — `51a609c` (absorb code + danish_realm final).**
New absorb-stage pass (default on; `--no-revalidate` to skip). Evicts a
composed_of member iff its normalised nominal GENUINELY differs from the
foundation's AND the two share NO agreeing type-level catalogue — the SAME
nominal discriminator shipped in `match_pair`, applied to existing
membership. **Uses the merge module's synonym-aware `_normalise_nominal`
(imported as `_mg_normalise_nominal`), NOT v2_seed_writer's bare one** —
else synonym pairs («1 Ducat» vs «1 Dukat») false-evict (caught in dry-run:
18→12 once the normaliser was fixed). The weight-tier disambiguator is
DELIBERATELY NOT used (same-nominal weight divergence = specimen variance,
not a different coin; verified 24/38 weight-tier drops were same-nominal).
Evicted members are surgically decontaminated off the host
(`_surgical_decontaminate`: only their EXCLUSIVE weight/source values
removed — orphan + remaining-member data preserved per §9a; twin-
independent, no clean-snapshot needed), dropped from composed_of, and
force-promoted standalone (reuses the over-merge-purge `forced_evict_promote`
path) so they re-home; the discriminator then blocks re-absorption.
danish_realm: 12 evictions / 8 hosts → 10 re-homed standalone + 2 matched
into correct existing finals; **0 coins lost**.

**(B) Nominal folds — `1d08444` (`lib/nominal_synonyms.py`).** Two residual-
edge folds for the discriminator (issuer-PREFIX «Oldenburg. Taler» was
already handled by `_strip_region_prefixes`): worth-equivalence tail strip
(`= …` → "", handles «1 Thaler = 1/14 Cölln. Mark» + the trailing weight-
standard gloss) + `_strip_mint_suffix` (drops trailing «. <Mint>[ og <Mint>]»
when the segment is mint-only — «4 Skilling Rigsmønt. København og Altona»
→ «4 skilling rigsmont»; conservative, leaves «100 Rd. Conr.» / «Cölln. Mark»).

**(C) Full re-merge + re-absorb — `2fcde35` (22 seed_unified + 5 final + 19 cd).**
Materialises the discriminator + both folds across ALL 22 entities (prior
ship covered only 4). 26651 seeds → 17337 unified (9314 merges). **Seed
conservation verified — ZERO seeds lost everywhere**; only `_unclassified`
grew (+322 newly-harvested seeds entering the merge → classification
backlog, NOT a loss). danish_norway/royal_holstein/bremen_verden finals
net −6/−1/−1 from legitimate cross-source de-dup (all underlying seeds
confirmed still reaching a final). KM 42 stays clean (idempotent).

**Deferred / open after this task:**
- **`_unclassified` +322 classification backlog** — newly-harvested seeds
  now in `seed_unified/_unclassified.yml` awaiting entity routing.
- **General re-validate re-homing across transitive over-merges** — the
  current pass evicts identity-mismatches one-level; a transitivity-aware
  variant (re-home dropped members that themselves anchor a sub-cluster)
  was scoped but deferred as regression-prone — own focused session.
- «= X» / «Rd. Conr.» nominals beyond the folds above are curator-territory
  (genuinely ambiguous worth-equivalences) — left as-is.

## Catalog-index normalization + KMM thinning (2026-06-08) — SHIPPED, 5 commits UNPUSHED

Started as the «1 Speciedaler Christian IV (Hede 55)» 3-problem task, grew into a
project-wide index refactor + a museum-citation declutter. **All committed locally,
UNPUSHED (48 total unpushed). Pre-commit hook passed throughout; full V2 build clean,
0 `schou#`/`sieg#` overflow site-wide.**

**(A) Catalog-index normalization — `17c7e91` (code) + `75734e6` (data, all entities).**
- `lib/catalog_codes.py::normalise_catalog()` — folds `others: <code># N` overflow
  into its typed list-field (case-insensitive code, guarded against cf-/unlisted-),
  + case-insensitive value de-dup («Hede 55C» + «55c» → one «55C»). Wired into EVERY
  catalog-write chokepoint: `seed_merge.merge_one` (post deep-merge), `v2_seed_writer`
  pre-write hygiene, `merge_seeds_cross_source.build_unified`, `absorb._enrich_final_entry`
  + a blanket pass over every final entry (catches V1-carryover foundations).
- **Restart-scope registry in `_catalog_refs`** (the §9.4 core): two records sharing an
  index VALUE match only when they share its RESTART scope. Empirically measured:
  **Hede 59 %, Schou 64 %, Sieg 42 %** of distinct values span ≥2 reigns → **per-ruler**
  (`<idx>/<ruler>`); **KM 43 %** spans ≥2 entities → per-register; Galster per-volume;
  Friedberg/Davenport/Numista/Bruun/Lange/NMD/Schive/Skaare/mb (~0 %) → global/bare.
  **Sieg + Schou were BARE before (a §9.4 cross-reign collision bug); now ruler-scoped.**
  `_catalog_chain_consistent` value-compare + both SUB_VARIANT_REFS membership tests
  made scope-aware (`k.split("/",1)[0]`) + case-insensitive.
- Rollout regression analysis (`scripts/oneoff/analyze_index_rollout_regressions.py`,
  gitignored): **0 cross-ruler false-merges**; contained to 3 Danish entities (others 0
  grouping change); 66 §9a museum-specimen consolidations; flagged «anomalies» all
  accounting-equivalent nominals (12 RD Courant = 2 RD Species; 4 Mark = 1 Speciedaler;
  16 Skilling = 1 Mark) + billon/silver — catalog-driven per §9.4. No over-merges.

**(B) natmus errata — `18a5fbe`.** KMM 275643 «2 Skilling 1625» typeNumber «Hede 141»
is wrong (Hede 141 = 8 Skilling 1630, confirmed by genuine specimen KMM 190547 +
danskmoent c4h141; a 2-Skilling 1625 is uniquely Hede 134; natmus's OWN sibling
KMM 335046 is tagged «H. 134A»). `_source_errata` hede 141→134 on the kmk seed
(durable, survives rebuild via `_PRESERVE_ALWAYS_KEYS`). Specimen now groups with
Hede 134; KMM 190547 stands alone as Hede 141.

**(C) KMM museum-citation thinning — `7d37a92` (code) + `758cfba` (data).** 3-category
declutter in `absorb._suppress_weightless_museum_overcollection`, keyed by what each
KMM record carries (image read from cache `related.assets[type=still]` — VERIFIED
equal to the natmus page: 290904 shows 3 photos / 123284 shows «Genstanden er endnu
ikke affotograferet»):
- WEIGHT (±image): untouched — the §9a weight-specimen thinning owns those; always shown.
- IMAGE only (no weight): keep 3 (lowest object-id), hide rest.
- NEITHER (79 % of all KMM cites): keep 1, hide rest.
Hidden via `display: false` (data kept §9a — not deleted); 3266 surplus hidden, 0 weight
hidden. Constants `_KEEP_KMM_IMAGE_ONLY=3` / `_KEEP_KMM_PURE=1`.

**(D) Verified-mint divergence disqualifier — `775660e` (code) + `e8f6215` (data).**
RESOLVED the 290904 question + the whole Christian-IV Wolfenbüttel war-coinage cluster.
`match_pair` now blocks a merge when both coins have VERIFIED disjoint scalar mints AND
no strong TYPE-level catalogue tie (KM/Hede/Galster/Dav/Fr/Lange — not Schou/Sieg). So
the Wolfenbüttel coins (mint Wolfenbüttel verified) no longer false-merge into København
Hede 55 (mint Kopenhagen verified) via colliding Schou. `_shares_type_level_catalog`
tolerates case-insensitive + numeric-core + bare-vs-dot-parent («579»≡«579.1»). Full
re-merge of all 22 entities: **0 verified-mint splits of legit groups** (the 1 candidate
was a dot-parent gap, fixed); effect contained to danish_realm. KMM 290904 + 291969 now
separate seed_unsorted Wolfenbüttel coins; KMM 348808 (genuine Hede 55) stays in c4h55;
foundation mint cleaned [Kopenhagen, Wolfenbüttel] → Kopenhagen. 3 no_merges added
(290904↔348808, 290904↔c4h55, 348808↔291969).

**DONE this session (latest first):**
- ✅ **Nominal discriminator SHIPPED** (`fb7bc80` code, `a6e7f8b` data). `match_pair` now
  blocks a merge when normalised nominals GENUINELY differ (synonym folds + daler/gylden
  wildcard exclude label-variance) AND there's no TYPE-LEVEL catalogue tie (shared KM/Hede/
  Galster/Dav/Fr/Lange/N#, not a weak per-reign Schou/Sieg) — mirrors the §9.4 mint
  discriminator. Caught + fixed a Halvkrone/1½ collision: the «Halv-X» fold now consumes the
  implicit-one («1 Halvkrone»=½ krone, not «1 1/2 krone»). Full re-merge + re-absorb (15
  entities): NET de-dup (table folds > discriminator splits) — danish_realm final 7482→7455,
  royal_holstein 944→941, danish_norway 2101→2099, gottorp +1; 11 entities unchanged.
  Validate + build OK. ~2 residual edge false-splits left (see 🟢 below).
- ✅ **Mixed-number fraction fix** (`6238372`). `normalise_nominal` garbled «1½ Thaler» →
  «11/2 daler» (no separator between whole part + vulgar fraction). Now inserts a zero-width
  space before ANY unicode fraction following a digit (½⅓⅔¼¾⅕⅖⅗⅘⅙⅚⅛⅜⅝⅞) → «1 1/2», and the
  leading-«1 » strip gains `(?!\d)` so «1 1/2» isn't collapsed to «1/2». 0 corruption left;
  «1½» now matches the spelled «1 1/2». Maintenance-side — materializes a few 1½↔1-1/2 de-dup
  matches on the next full re-merge.
- ✅ **Full Numista re-parse materialization** (submodule `b77926fe` 398 sidecars; main
  data commit + classification_decisions). RE-PARSE only (no re-harvest — cache unchanged,
  0 API quota). `parse_numista --force` → `build_numista_seed` → `merge` (15 entities) →
  `absorb` (15). Materialized: 398 types' §9a multi-ref list-form (hede/sieg/schou/km/lange/
  fr/dav) + the session's synonym/Dav-fold/KM-hygiene across all entities. Side-effects of
  the full --force: **+322 newly-parsed types → `_unclassified`** (harvested-but-never-parsed;
  NOT rendered) + **+13 new coins → landgrafschaft_hessen_kassel** (final 77→86, pending
  classification). De-dup from richer refs: danish_realm 7492→7482, royal_holstein 946→944,
  danish_norway 2102→2101 (correct merges, NOT loss; validate OK, build OK).
- ✅ **Davenport volume-fold** (`bc1f9d7` code, `92557b3` data). «EC II» = Davenport
  «European Crowns 1600-1700» (a VOLUME, not a source artifact; numbering continuous, so
  «Dav 3668» = «EC II 3668»). `normalise_catalog` step 4 drops a bare «N» from the dav
  list when a volume-qualified «<VOL> N» (EC/GT/SG/BrSL) with the same trailing number is
  present; bare-with-no-match is kept. Materialized on 145 coins / 9 entities (148 bare
  lines, pure deletion, no re-convergence). This bare+qualified accumulation was a
  side-effect of the multi-KM session's dav accumulation.
- ✅ **Nominal synonym table**
- ✅ **Numista multi-KM support + §9a catalogue accumulation** (`29b5de2` code, `c42c31d`
  data, submodule `d283dd2a`). `numista_canonical.parse_references` (API+chrome) now
  ACCUMULATES every distinct catalogue value into a deduped list instead of first-wins —
  a single Numista type can cite multiple KM (406.1/406.2 mint sub-variants, or 106/56
  across two Krause editions). KM comma-decimals normalise to dots (404,1→404.1).
  `seed_merge` catalog deep-merge UNIONs list-capable sub-fields (was existing-key-wins,
  which silently dropped the fresh 2nd KM); frozen-catalog curation still wins.
  `catalog_codes.normalise_catalog` km hygiene: slash-scalar 683.1/683.2 → list, comma→dot,
  dedup. Materialized for danish_realm + gottorp_duchy (5 types render multi-KM, verified;
  resolved a dup 207063↔65186, 7493→7492 no loss; 683 slash-scalar fixed). **Other 14
  Numista entities' seeds REVERTED** — their lange/dav/fr §9a accumulation (21 multi-ref
  types total: lange 7, dav 6, km 5, fr 2) materializes on the next FULL pipeline run
  (parse --force → build_numista_seed → merge → absorb ALL entities); code is committed.
- ✅ **Catalog-index sort + range-collapse** (`94d6213`). `compute._compute_catalog_groups`
  now expands every index value to its integer members (existing ranges + overlapping/
  adjacent inputs merge: `23-24`+`25-26`+`26` → `23-26`), collapses runs of ≥3 consecutive
  ints into `min-max`, keeps 1-2 runs as individual numbers, and sorts the whole group.
  Applies to ALL index groups (Schou/Sieg/KM/Hede/Lange/…); non-integer tokens (93A, 77.1,
  register-qualified) never collapse and keep parent-before-sub-variant order. Verified on
  KM-42: `Schou# 21, 24, 25, 28, 32-36, 40, 42, 46-48, 51, 52, 56-59, 61, 62, 64, 68, 71-76,
  83, 89, 90, 93, 95, 97-99`. NB: a 2-element run renders as two numbers per the ≥3 rule
  (one-line threshold change if the user later wants ≥2).
- ✅ **Rhinsk Gylden fuss fix** (`896ffef` classifier, `2dc3adf` data). Christian III 1546
  Flensburg gold Rhinsk Gylden (Hede c3h14 «1 Rhinsk Gylden» + c3h15 «2 Rhinsk Gylden»)
  were mis-placed in the SILVER `8_daler_lybsk_fod` by the over-broad Flensborg mint-anchor
  rule (§8a metal-mismatch). Root-cause fix: `allowed_metals` gate on `_MINT_BOUND_FUSSES`
  bindings (gold can't match a silver Fuß). Moved both → `rhinsk_gylden_fod` phase 0 (joins
  the 1536 Roskilde galster-c3g-131; Δ −1.7 % vs soll). Added fraction '2' (soll 6.496/5.002),
  new ref `danskmoent-c3-rhinsk-gylden-1546` (Galster 130, NFM XII s.10), denmark.yml Phase-0
  prose (bar year_to 1536→1546 + title + description + hintergrund + pdate hiatus 27y→17y).
  Verified via computed JSON: both under rhinsk_gylden_fod phase 0, fraction 1/2. The 3
  seed_unsorted Rhinsk Gylden (f2h7g, galster-hg-27, galster-hg-gej) are a SEPARATE
  classification thread — not touched.
- ✅ **§9a weight-thinning → pipeline** (`fb91804` code, `264c4a8` data). `FieldValue.
  display:bool=True` + `compute.normalise_field` skips display:false + `absorb._suppress_
  weightless_museum_overcollection` now thins the weight-giving KMM bucket (≥5 → keep
  min/middle/max by weight, hide the dropped citations + their weight readings by value;
  catalog untouched). 1320 display:false across danish_realm/danish_norway/royal_holstein,
  0 deletions. Verified end-to-end: KM-42 weight column 44→5 readings. **CAVEAT surfaced:**
  the kept min for KM-42 is 0.44 g = the «Denning» anomaly — thinning correctly keeps the
  envelope extremes, so sticky wrong-type specimens now show as min/max. → the re-validate
  pass below is now also needed to keep the thinned envelope CLEAN.

**OPEN / next (all user-directed this session — designs captured, NOT yet built):**
- 🟡 **re-validate-composed_of absorb pass (HIGHEST leverage — now doubly motivated).** The
  absorb NEVER re-validates existing composed_of members (only adds), so historical bad
  merges are STICKY — they survive every re-run + every new discriminator. This is why
  c4h55's foundation mint stayed polluted, and why KM-42 (`dk-tid-163034`, 8 Skilling
  Christian IV) STILL carries 2 wrong-type specimens despite weight-tier-1 already
  rejecting them: **KMM 137199 «Denning» 0.44 g «Sch 83»** (Russian-kopeck imitation) +
  **KMM 591520 «4 Skilling Lybsk Rytterpenning» 1.822 g «Sch 42»** — both merged via a
  bare-Schou collision with the Hede-93 Schou cross-refs. NOW the weight-thinning surfaces
  the 0.44 Denning as the displayed min, so this pass is the clean-up. The fix: an absorb
  pass that re-runs `match_pair(member, foundation)` over every existing composed_of member
  and DROPS those now `no_match`. Self-heals the whole sticky class (KM-42 anomalies via
  weight-tier-1, Wolfenbüttel residue via mint discriminator). Uses only SAFE existing
  discriminators — no synonym risk. MUST dry-run with a printed drop-list for review.
- 🟢 **Residual discriminator edge false-splits (curator-mergeable, low priority).** After
  shipping (below), ~2 edge categories still split as FALSE on danish_realm: a trailing
  «. <mint>» annotation («4 Skilling Rigsmønt. København og Altona» vs «4 Skilling Rigsmønt»)
  and «= X» equivalence nominals («12 Rigsdaler courant = 2 Rigsdaler» vs «2 Rigsdaler»). Too
  niche/risky for a broad fold; if they surface as real duplicates, merge via
  `merge_decisions/`. The forgery splits («1 Skilling samtidig forfalskning» vs «1 Skilling»)
  are arguably LEGIT (distinct items) — leave.
- 🟡 **Classify the 13 new Hesse-Kassel Numista coins** (`data/v2/classification_decisions/
  landgrafschaft_hessen_kassel.yml` pending list). They entered as `seed_unsorted` in the
  full re-parse below — assign fuss/phase (or fix matcher rules) per PB Phase-4. The 322
  new `_unclassified` Numista types are NOT rendered and need no action unless a future
  classification pass routes them.
- 🟢 **Rhinsk Gylden seed_unsorted tail (follow-up to the c3h14/c3h15 fix above).** 3 gold
  Rhinsk Gylden still sit in `seed_unsorted`: `f2h7g` (Frederik II), `galster-hg-27`,
  `galster-hg-gej`. They belong in `rhinsk_gylden_fod` too — classify them (the metal-gate
  fix means a re-run of auto_classify won't mis-route them to silver). «1 Denning» (c4h169)
  = Russian-kopeck-imitation trade coin (1619 Glückstadt) — stays soll-less, NOT Rhinsk.
- 🟢 **Foundation-mint pollution (systemic note).** c4h55's foundation had accumulated a
  wrong mint (Wolfenbüttel) from historical bad merges; the absorb matches against the
  STORED foundation mint (re-derives only in enrich, AFTER matching), so the pollution
  survived re-runs until cleaned by hand. Other foundations may carry similar pollution —
  a «re-validate existing composed_of members against the current matcher» absorb pass
  would self-heal both this and the sticky-member problem.
- 🟢 `mb` index (24 % xEntity, 0 % xRuler) left bare — verify restart axis + scope if
  per-region.

## Soll/Δ-gap sweep (2026-06-07) — 8 coins fixed, 16 surfaced

User flagged on the rendered Denmark page: rows with weight+fineness (so a
Feingewicht is computed) but blank Soll/Δ. Root cause: the build's `_compute_coin`
needs `coin.fraction` to be a key in `fuss.fractions`; many coins had
`fraction: None` (or a fraction the fuss didn't define). **Audit any time with
`scripts/maintenance/audit_hede_seed_loss.py`-style logic OR the inline check
(weight+fineness present, fuss≠seed_unsorted, fraction not in fuss.fractions).**

**FIXED (commits b79ae73, b59267b):** Nobel 2/3 (added nobel_fod fractions «2»/«3»
= 2x/3x the per-Nobel Soll, §0 computation attribution) + 7 coins where the fuss
already defined the key, fraction just None → set deterministic Δ-verified value:
rhinsk_gylden_fod «1»; 8_daler_fod 1 Gulden «1» / 8 Skilling «1/6» (1 Daler=48 Sk);
18_5_thaler 8 Rigsbankskilling «1/12» (8/96) / 16 Rbsk «1/6» (16/96). All Δ within
tolerance.

**SURFACED — 16 coins still soll-gap, need curator decision (NOT auto-set):**
  - `reichsdukatenfuss` «4 Speciedaler» (unified-dk-numista-117501) — LIKELY
    MIS-CLASSIFIED: silver .875 4-Speciedaler (fein 100.71 ≈ 4× 9¼-Speciedaler)
    sitting under a GOLD Dukat fuss. Re-classify to 9_25_thaler «4» (or 9_thaler)?
  - `11_333_thaler` «3 Krone» (numismaster-65368) — gold .993, fein 44.97; ratio
    under this fuss unclear (possible gold-under-silver-fuss mismatch).
  - Scheidemünze / billon sub-denoms where a full-Kurant Soll would be misleading
    (the −% IS the seigniorage per §6 — curator call whether to show it):
    `8_daler_fod` 1 Hvid / 1 Penning / 2 Skilling ×5; `9_thaler` 1 Denning;
    `9_25_thaler` 3 Skilling Lybsk ×5 (Lybsk-skilling ratio needed);
    `8_daler_lybsk_fod` 2 Rhinsk Gylden.
  - Note: fraction auto-derivation (`absorb`/`lib.fraction_infer`) only runs on
    newly-absorbed entries + can't resolve sub-unit ratios (8 Rbsk→1/12) — a
    general «derive fraction over ALL final entries + sub-unit ratio table» pass
    is the proper long-term fix.

## Current focus

**V2 entity-keyed refactor — architecture refined 2026-05-18 to
4-phase fully-automated pipeline with V1 reframed as FOUNDATION
(V1 final yamls become V2 final starting state; V2 accumulates
enrichments on top, never overwrites).** Curator no longer edits
coin fields by hand; curator input is restricted to (a) which entities
the project supports, (b) Phase 3 merge confirmations, (c) Phase 4
classification confirmations — all encoded in script rules or
explicit decision files. Worktree branch `feat/v2-pipeline`.
**Canonical decisions journal: `docs/V2_DECISIONS.md`** (28 + 4
deferred). Detailed plan: `docs/V2_PIPELINE.md`. Detailed
architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §«V2 entity-keyed pipeline».
All other workstreams below paused during V2 unless user redirects.

**§CT — Hede parser data-loss audit (2026-06-06). Catalog-graph tool
(`scripts/maintenance/catalog_graph.py` — promoted from gitignored
`scripts/oneoff/` on 2026-06-07; committed + inventoried in the
maintenance README) surfaced 3 parser losses. Status mixed:**
- **SHIPPED (`49d4727` + cache `f71534b08`, committed, UNPUSHED):**
  per-variant Schou «hhv. … og …» list drop (81 by_letter variants).
  Safe — adds Schou values to existing entries, no id change.
- **SHIPPED — year-prefix Schou (`090b033` + cache `00cd21fb4`):**
  «Schou 1829-37: 2» (year-range : die) / «Schou 1731,1» (Schou
  year,running-no) — systemic `:`-sep + `_strip_year_tokens` (1500-1950,
  Dav exempt). id-safe (0 by_letter changes). f6h4b → 2,3 ; c6h4 →
  1,2,3 landed via 2 targeted seed edits (catalog is DEEP_MERGE so the
  cleaned fresh value couldn't overwrite the stale existing one).
- **SHIPPED — by_letter year-less recovery, Option B (`3fee3fa` + cache
  `62ce09dc2`):** `_extract_letter_groups` no longer requires a year on
  the variant line → +33 pages / +51 seed sub-variant entries (c4h117 →
  117A/117B etc.). The id change (bare `dk-hede-c4h112` → `c4h112a/b`)
  is handled WITHOUT changing the id mechanism (user steer):
  (a) `lib/seed_merge.py` supersession-drop (uncurated bare with FRESH
  sub-letter siblings is dropped — no bare+subletter dup);
  (b) `merge_seeds_cross_source.py::_expand_member` — a merge_decision
  member that is a now-absent Hede bare expands to its sub-letters
  (`dk-hede-c4h112` → {`c4h112a`,`c4h112b`}); genuinely-missing →
  warn+skip (no KeyError). force_union unions all; no_merge pairs only
  across DISTINCT original members. Result: c4h112 «Hede 112 = KM 68»
  applies to both 112A+112B; Hede 117 unifies 117A+117B (the «117B
  dropped» was a stale-merge artifact — clean run unions all). Verified
  via dry-run: 0 by_letter regressions, 0 unified entries lost, +12 net,
  schema OK.
- **REMAINING loss — RE-AUDITED 2026-06-07 (the old «76/53/22/16» count
  was STALE; c4h163/c4h164 are seeded now).** Run
  `scripts/maintenance/audit_hede_seed_loss.py` for the live breakdown.
  Current (662 cache pages): **515 OK, 3 sub_letter_loss, 12 field_swap,
  93 in_scope_absent, 25 oos_post_1914, 14 exonumia.** The actionable
  buckets:
  - **field_swap — Part 1 (nominal) + Part 2 (mint) SHIPPED 2026-06-07
    (commits 3cc3272, 5f6ed52). RESOLVED.** Recovered +34 seed coins
    (danish_realm +20, royal_holstein +14); audit OK 515→526, field_swap
    12→0. Part 2 mechanic: parse_hede.py recovers the mint from the per-variant
    A)/B)/C) lines when the H1 is mint-less — PER-LETTER on by_letter pages
    (78A=København, 78B=Helsingør; verbatim so the builder's _normalize_mints
    matches), AGGREGATE multi-mint on single-coin pages (c7h35). Builder
    by_letter path uses the per-letter mint (fallback to top-level), no-mint
    skip deferred when by_letter supplies mints. Verified 0 removed / 0
    existing-coin mint changes. **Still at the seed layer — run merger→absorb
    to render.** REMAINING field-swap residue: c4h53 (by_hede — needs
    per-spec-group mint, each by_hede group can span mints) + 5 no-variant-mint
    pages (c3h23, f6h1, f6h5, f6h26, f7h7 — no recognised mint on their lines;
    nominal fixed by Part 1, stay absent). Historical detail below:
  - **(superseded) field_swap Part 1-only note (commit 3cc3272).**
    Pages whose descriptor line is «Ruler, NOMINAL» (comma right after the
    ruler, NO mint; mint per-variant on A)/B)/C) lines) had the NOMINAL
    field-swapped into `mint`. parse_hede.py now extracts nominal correctly
    (new `_is_denomination` guard; lone denom-shaped segment after the
    ruler-comma = nominal, not mint). Verified: exactly the 13 pages change
    (nominal set, mint→None), 0 regressions on 843 others. audit field_swap
    12→0. **Part 2 (mint recovery, ~32 coins) NOT done — the real blocker.**
    These pages still don't seed: the mint now lives on the per-variant lines
    and must be recovered PER SUB-VARIANT (78A=København, 78B=Helsingør —
    NOT one aggregate). The simple aggregate-mint version was implemented +
    REVERTED after spot-check showed it mis-assigns (78A shown as Helsingør;
    also `display_for_alias` «Kopenhagen» gets dropped by the builder's
    _normalize_mints which keys on verbatim «København»). Correct Part 2 needs:
    (a) per-letter mint in `_extract_letter_groups` (scan each A)/B)/C) body
    for a registry mint, store VERBATIM); (b) per-hede mint for by_hede pages
    (c4h53); (c) builder by_letter + by_hede paths use the per-sub-variant mint
    (with fallback to top-level). Blast radius: ALL ~80 by_letter pages gain a
    `mint` key → must dry-run measure existing-coin mint changes before shipping.
    Affected field-swap pages: c3h23, c4h53, c4h78, c8h3, f6h24/26/27, f6h5,
    f7h1/4/6/7 (+ bonus mint-less recoveries c7h35, c8h1, f7h11/16/17).
  - **sub_letter_loss (3):** c4h163 (missing B — «Fortuna til randen for
    neden», empty sub-variant line), f4h44 (missing B), f5h3 (A vs B case).
  - **in_scope_absent (93):** mostly pages with no single `specs.default`/
    `specs.by_hede` block, multi-coin pages («1, 2 og 3 speciedaler»),
    undated «u.år» pages, or sub-variant-only «None»-nominal pages
    (c4h124-136, c5h131-135). Per-case review; lower priority.
  - **51 case-mismatched hede sub-letters** (kmk lowercase «119b» vs hede
    «119B») — graph fixed; DATA still case-split. Systemic fix pending
    (normalise hede sub-letter to uppercase at merger ingest / per-builder).
- **Curator verdicts (catalog_graph.py, 2026-06-06).** Two journals:
  `CURATOR_LINKS` = IDENTITY (✔-edge, → `merge_decisions::merges`):
  Hede 96 = KM 42; KM 80.1 = Hede 117/Sieg 41; KM 80.2 = Hede 116/Sieg 40;
  Hede 118 = KM 66; Hede 119 = KM 67; **Hede 108 = 109 = 110 = KM 259**
  (2 Mark Frederik III — all one coin); **Hede 93 = KM 32; Hede 91 = KM
  32.1** (8 Skilling Christian IV — Hede 96 = KM 42 above); **Hede 90 = 94 =
  KM 401** (1 Krone Christian V — all one coin despite the Hede 90/94 split;
  Dav 3642/3643/3645 hang off KM 401.x); **Hede 27 = KM 419 = KM 416** (2 Dukat
  Christian V — Hede 27 carries TWO KM numbers, unusual but factual);
  **Hede 26 = KM 413; Hede 31 = KM 415** (1 Dukat Christian V);
  **Hede 87 = 91 = 95 = KM 186-family = KM 192-family** (1 Krone Frederik III
  = 4 Mark Danske — ALL one coin despite two KM families + three Hede; f3h91
  nominal printed «4 Mark» — surface nominal divergence in match_uncertainty).
  `CURATOR_DISTINCT` = DIFFERENT-COIN (no edge, → `merge_decisions::no_merges`):
  Hede 10 ≠ Hede 14 (2 Dukat Frederik V); Hede 91 ≠ 93 ≠ 96 (8 Skilling Chr IV
  — KM 32.1 / KM 32 / KM 42); **Hede 27 ≠ 56 ≠ 58** (2 Dukat Christian V —
  three distinct coins); **Hede 26 ≠ 29 ≠ 31 ≠ 32** (1 Dukat Christian V — four
  distinct coins; KM 412 + KM A433 also separate. CAVEAT: shared «Schou 8»
  vertex bridges Hede 29↔32 but per curator is most-likely a DIFFERENT die for
  each — not evidence of identity). Hub colouring driven by `PROCESSED` — **ALL
  9 components done (green ✓) as of 2026-06-07.** STANDING TASK (user): work
  through ALL graph cases, recording each verdict — **COMPLETE**.
  **PROMOTED to `merge_decisions/danish_realm.yml` (2026-06-07, commit 80026ab):**
  3 merges (comp 1/2/4 all-one-coin) + 14 no_merges (comp 3/5/7/8/9 distinctness).
  seed_unified re-merged 7908→7895 (−13); verified 0 outsiders, all no_merge pairs
  distinct. **NOT promoted (catalog-attribution, need §4 _source_errata not merge):**
  comp 3 Hede96=KM42 (numista-15669 labels itself Hede 93A), comp 7 Hede26=KM413 /
  Hede31=KM415, comp 8 Hede27=KM419 — these reassign a KM our data attributes to a
  DIFFERENT Hede, so merging would unite curator-distinct coins. See FINAL-CONSOLIDATION below.
- **Graph node-merge rules (`scripts/maintenance/catalog_graph.py`):** per-ruler
  namespacing; Hede sub-letters → one base vertex (case-insensitive
  119A=119a); Schou dies → one set-vertex per Hede; **Sieg dot-sub-numbers
  → one base vertex** (32.1-32.4 → «Sieg 32.x», sub-classes of one coin —
  unlike KM, whose .N can be different coins per §9.4); Dav EC-volume
  prefix stripped; `_resolve_member` self-heals merge-shifted unified-ids.

**SUPERSEDED — the old «Component-5 cross-Hede DATA merge» note (2026-06-06,
«merge 116+117+numista-197176»).** The later SYSTEMATIC component-5 verdict
(catalog_graph pass, user msg «2 скілінга це дві різні монети») is the opposite:
Hede 116 (KM 80.2 / Sieg 40) ≠ Hede 117 (KM 80.1 / Sieg 41) — TWO distinct coins.
This also matches the already-committed Group-B decisions (which keep KM 80.1 /
MC_65041 separate from Hede 116). The split verdict is now pinned via
`merge_decisions::no_merges` (comp 5, commit 80026ab). Do NOT resurrect the
old merge — it was wrong.

**PENDING — FINAL-LAYER CONSOLIDATION of the comp-1/2/4 merges (2026-06-07).**
The seed_unified merge is done (merge_decisions + commit 80026ab), but the
`final/danish_realm.yml` layer still has each merged coin SPLIT across multiple
foundations with CONFLICTING fuss — the merge surfaced a bulk-promote
mis-classification. `absorb` is foundation-immutable (DF1): it flags
«curator classification clash» and SKIPS (won't auto-consolidate). The
`classification_decisions::assignments` mechanism ADDS new finals (for
genuinely-new coins) — it does NOT reclassify/merge EXISTING clashing
foundations. So consolidation needs either a new foundation-merge step or
manual foundation surgery. Curator-guided fuss (user 2026-06-07: «з кронами
ясно kronemont; з марками менш очевидно, не критично, якщо неясно лишай
seed_unsorted»):
  - comp 2  1 Krone Christian V 1690-92  → `kronemont/II` (clear: majority +
            Hede pieces already kronemont/II; precedent «1 Krone Chr V 1676-78»).
  - comp 4  2 Mark Frederik III 1665-67  → `kronemont/I` (clear: all 3 final
            entries already agree kronemont/I; precedent «2 Mark Frk III 1652»).
  - comp 1  1 Krone Frederik III 1652-53 → `kronemont`, phase AMBIGUOUS: Hede
            piece f3h91 = kronemont/I, ucoin piece tid-97152 = kronemont_chr_iv/II;
            both phases' data list «1 Krone Frk III 1652-1653». 9_25_thaler/I
            (numista-143477) is the clear mis-classification (Krone ≠ Speciedaler).
            Needs Hede standard-param check to settle I vs chr_iv/II.

**§CR + §CP/§CQ — KMK (8th specimen source) SHIPPED to final + pages
(2026-06-02/03). All committed locally, UNPUSHED.** Chain of work this
session:
- **Thinning** (`scripts/maintenance/thin_kmk_seed.py`, commit 822833d):
  KMK seed 42182 → 14443 per §9a weight-variance envelope (sort by
  weight, keep min/middle/max per ≥5 sub-variant bucket; id-sorted
  reps when no member has a weight). KMK `measurements` only ever
  carries `Vægt` (weight); ~14 % of object records carry it.
- **Merger hardened for scale** (59faeb4 + 0c26500 + 5a8d9d6): (a)
  memoise `_catalog_refs` (≈2.2×) GATED behind `_CATALOG_REFS_MEMO_ENABLED`
  — merger opts in per-entity-clear, absorb/audit/build leave it off
  (id(coin) reuse across entities would otherwise corrupt — the bug
  that inflated a danish_realm fold count 1→17); (b) **component-scoped
  no_merge** — PASS 1 collects confident+low only, PASS 2 registers
  no_merge ONLY within confident-connected components (≈0.5 % of O(n²))
  — fixes the real OOM that killed danish_realm (89.7M no_match
  frozensets ≈ 11 GB); (c) **PASS 1 parallelised** across cpu-1 worker
  processes (byte-identical, ~3.2×+; threshold `MERGE_PARALLEL_THRESHOLD`
  default 4000). Full re-merge now minutes, not 40-50 min.
- **`_collect_sources` .pdf fix** (7abc3f1) — THE root cause of the
  §CP/§CQ "conflicts": Bruun **Part II** PDF is the sole Bruun catalogue
  hosted on `danskmoent.dk/pdf/` (Parts I/III/IV on stacksbowers.com),
  so the `danskmoent.dk` single-page-host substring mis-classified it →
  url-only dedup collapsed every Part-II lot of a type to ONE citation.
  Guard `.pdf` URLs onto the multi-record (url,ref,type) path. Recovers
  Part-II citations project-wide (danish_norway 248→281). See
  SOURCES §13.
- **seed_unified regenerated** (9d8e08e) + **absorb --apply** (88aa100):
  9947 KMK bulk-promoted to V2 final (16957 total), 593 genuinely-new
  → `data/v2/classification_decisions/` pending (await curator
  fuss/phase). 50 enrichment conflicts remain — ALL benign specimen-
  level Bruun part/lot/page (anchor kept, alternatives in sources[];
  verified 0 citation loss). 1 benign self-foundation fold + 1 stale-
  purge (danish_realm).
- **KM-461 1699 2-Ducat corrected** (bb939ec): was the lone genuine
  conflict — V1 mis-tagged the Frederik IV 1699 *tronskifte* (throne-
  change) 2-Dukat as Christian V / Hede c5h-3 (c5h-3 is the unrelated
  1673 2-Dukat, Sieg 118). Now ruler=Frederik IV, hede_volume=f4h,
  rationale in `_curation_holds`; id slug `km-461-chr-v-1699` kept
  stable. Verified on rendered denmark page (tronskifte note + Frederik
  IV + recovered Bruun Part II lot 14032 all render).
- **Log-hygiene DONE** (a7967a9): `_deep_merge_catalog` no longer logs
  specimen-level `bruun_part/lot_no/page` disagreements as merge
  conflicts (they're expected multi-specimen, anchor + sources[]
  lossless per §9a — already excluded from MATCHING, now from the
  conflict LOG too). Verified all 50 were uniformly that pattern across
  1603→1874 (0 genuine among them). Output byte-identical (diagnostic /
  gitignored only). Genuine single-value conflicts (sieg_hede1971 /
  schou_hede1971 / hede_volume) still logged.
- **german_empire V2 final** (a8ffee0): absorb created it (27
  Reichswährung coins promoted); was untracked after the dir-pathspec
  absorb commit — now committed.
- **Next:** (a) `git push` main (15 commits UNPUSHED; submodule
  `scripts/cache` untouched this session → main only); (b) the 593
  KMK-pending coins in `classification_decisions/` await curator
  fuss/phase assignment (Phase 4).

**Mission temporal scope — Denmark-track anchor rescoped 1541 → 1514
on 2026-05-16 per §BI.** Denmark-Norway track lower bound = **1514**
(Christian II Lovkompleks: Møntordning af Sommeren 1514 Kopenhagen +
Møntordning af 3. August 1514 for Norge + Kvittering Paasketid 1515 +
Sjælland åbent Brev af 24. August 1515 — per Wilcke 1950 p. 183-186
verbatim); German-lands track unchanged at **1559 (1566)** (Augsburger
Reichsmüntzordnung). The 1541 Møntordning is now correctly framed as
the THIRD major Danish-Norwegian Møntordning in the Christian-II-
Lovkompleks lineage, not the first. TODO §BC closed; §BI in progress;
CLAUDE.md mission statement updated; `--year-from` default in seed
builder updated 1541→1514; seed regenerated; denmark.yml header /
timeline / summary deck rewritten. **Schleswig-Holstein + all German-
jurisdiction pages NOT touched** — they keep their 1559/1566 anchor
unchanged per §BI's explicit scope-restriction.

**§BI residual sub-tasks** (still in progress):
- Update `denmark_fuesse_year_boundaries.md` reichsdukat section to
  reference 1514 Lovkompleks as the verified first formal Danish
  gold-standard spec (Nobler 23½K 16/Mark establishes 23½K floor).
- Update `moentordning_1541.md` header annotation: position as
  Christian-III's-third Møntordning in Lovkompleks lineage.
- Update §BF scope-note: «1541-1566 gap» becomes «1514-1566 gap».
- Open sibling TODO for **Galster + Jensen-Skjoldager catalog import**
  (Christian II 1513-1523 + Frederik I 1523-1533 coverage — empty
  1514-1540 sub-window until that import lands). NOT a Hede extension
  — Hede 1957 itself does not catalogue pre-Christian-III rulers.

**§BF Denmark 1541-1566 gap (now «1514-1566 gap»)** sequenced AFTER
§BI lands. Original §BF four operational sub-tasks remain valid for
the 1541-1566 portion (8_daler_fod definition + fuss_periods
A1/A2 + seed-coin promotion c3h3-3A/3B + c3h4/5/7 + 4 new refs); the
pre-1541 portion (Christian II 1513-1523 + Frederik I 1523-1533)
becomes a fifth sub-task pending §AZ (Galster + Jensen-Skjoldager catalog import — new source family, not a Hede extension).

**Open §BF design question — Flensborg post-1544 track (Phase A3/A4)**:
separate `8_daler_lybsk_fod` Müntzfuß for Lybsk-aligned
sub-Mark + 14¼ Lod Daler, OR same Fuß with mint differentiation. Per
`moentordning_1541.md` §7.1 the 1547 Flensborg dual-zone is the
genealogical seed of later `18_5_thaler` / `34_marck` family vs
`9_thaler` family — likely deserves its own Fuß. Verdict pending.

**E1 NO-KM dedup audit on `data/locations/denmark.yml`** (parallel
front, separate from §BC follow-up) — methodology is per-case, with
explicit «за / проти merge» analysis, source links provided up-front
so the user can verify visually before any merge. Cases 1-9 of 46
done (case 9 = c4h79A/B/C/D folded into KM-16.1 + KM-16.2 as two
parallel merges, multi-source `weight_rough_g`/`fineness` preserved
per §9a). Next: **case 10 — c4h84 [A B]**.

The list of 46 cases is generated dynamically by the audit script
(see «Helper queries» section below); the per-case order isn't fixed
but reflects the `dup_pairs_denmark.txt` enumeration.

## Pending verifications awaiting user input

1. **ucoin Composition harvest** (3 productive sessions 2026-05-13;
   paused on Cloudflare). Three sessions cumulative: 121 new sidecar
   entries (98 → 219), 178 metal-field updates. Rate-limit threshold
   characterised: ~50 cumulative requests per session-cookie at any
   pacing 2.5-20 s. Session 4 attempt hit **Cloudflare bot-
   protection challenge** (HTTP 403 + «Just a moment…») which cookie-
   clear cannot bypass. Resume conditions: wait ~24h for Cloudflare
   cooldown, or pass the challenge manually via normal browser
   navigation, or switch IP. ~490 uncached ucoin URLs remain. See
   TODO §M for full details.

2. **Seed audit snapshot** (post-case-9 cleanup) — 605 total Denmark
   Hede-seed entries; 195 auto-suppressed, 9 metal-mismatch guard, 6
   weight-mismatch guard, 1 year-mismatch guard, 394 wholly uncurated.
   Of the 16 guard-survivors, 3 appear to be **false-positive weight-
   guards triggered by outlier values in curated `weight_rough_g[]`
   lists** (km-25 [.49], km-128 [8.428], hede-47 [6.93]); 1 metal-
   mismatch (c5h128 → km-79 SH) may be a billon/silver labelling drift
   that should have caught the fineness-similarity escape hatch but
   didn't. Worth a focused turn before continuing per-case dedup.
   Audit script: `scripts/oneoff/audit_seed_survivors.py` (gitignored).

2. **Case 8 retrospective rigor check** (in flight) — user pushed back
   that case 8 (Hede 59 → KM-100 / KM-135) skipped the per-case «за /
   проти» discipline. I provided all KM-100 source links; awaiting
   user's verdict on whether the «Numista 109973 Bust type I =
   Hede 59A + 59B» mapping is acceptable on year-span-match alone,
   or needs direct obverse-design verification. Same question stands
   for KM-135 (Hede 59C 1646 — no Numista entry, sourced only from
   curator's prior «KM-DK# 135» note).

   ⇒ If user accepts: continue to case 9.
   ⇒ If not: revisit case 8, possibly partial rollback + verification.

2. **«Curated (legacy scalar)» legacy cleanup verification** — just
   purged 45 placeholder entries from `fineness` lists in denmark.yml
   per the new verified-wins-over-unverified rule. Build clean, render
   correct (sample-checked hede-44). User asked for verification
   before any push. ⇒ Awaiting «OK to push» or further checks.

## Harvest routine — anomaly investigation (2026-05-29)

Investigated the autonomous harvest routine's self-logged anomalies
(`scripts/cache/_harvest_handoff.json::runs[].anomalies`). Two systemic,
one class transient.

- **IKMK discovery noise → ✅ scope-purged.** `fetch_ikmk.py` uses
  full-text `quick_search` + a **year-only** fetch filter, so the cache
  had filled to ~90 % out-of-scope. Purged 5791/7259 records (cache
  103→28 MB), kept 1468 German/Scandinavian coins + borderline-HRE.
  Landed on **main** (submodule commit `07014b3`, superproject pointer
  bump `651633d`) — not the worktree, due to a `cd /main` slip; curator
  accepted keeping it there. Keep-rule + verification recorded in
  `scripts/cache/ikmk/_oos_purged_by_scope_2026-05.json` and SOURCES.md
  §13.8. **Durable filter landed** (commit `48dc101`, worktree branch):
  `fetch_ikmk.py` now gates fetch + `scan_cache` on `_is_in_entity_scope`
  (country + object-type); the year-only `_is_in_mission_scope` gate is
  removed. Per the curator's multi-level scope (2026-05-29) year is NOT a
  drop criterion — German/Scandinavian (+ lands under their rule) of ANY
  era are broad keep-scope; only other-country coins + exonumia are
  dropped. Validated: entity-only filter flags just 2 of 1478 cached (a
  British Sovereign + a Koch medal — routine-added OOS the old year gate
  let slip), keeps all 326 German/Scandinavian records outside 1514-1914.
- **ucoin `osnabruck_p3057` skip-loop (occ≥10) → ✅ fixed.** Bucket
  «Bishopric of Osnabrück 1482-1661» — first gap-TIDs were pre-1559 OOS,
  so the picker re-offered + skipped it every run. Re-enumerated per-TID
  years via the ucoin listing (Chrome, 2 pages, 55 TIDs) and split
  `_BR_audit-4_2026-05-24.json::osnabruck_p3057.gap_tids` into 29
  in-scope (1631-1662) + 26 `oos_excluded_tids` (1482-1541). gap_tids now
  lists only the in-scope set, so the routine harvests the 1631-1662
  coins and the skip-loop ends. Committed on the **worktree** branch
  (submodule `417ab9d`, pointer bump `620241f`). Since reconciled:
  `origin/main` was merged into the branch (`f989f9b`), unioning the
  IKMK purge (origin) with this p3057 split in submodule merge `d385a7a`;
  a follow-up normalised the audit JSON back to the routine's indent=2
  (`e475a36` / pointer `04a17a7`). The branch's cache submodule now
  carries both changes.
- **Transient (no action):** chrome-mcp-disconnect (16:34 run),
  cloudflare interstitials (auto-cleared), `osnabruck_p2988` audit label
  drift («Hochstift» vs «City of Osnabrück»).

### Numista — 8 of 8 buckets enumerated (BO.6 v3 complete)

✅ **Verified clean (5 buckets, 671 NIDs):**

| Bucket | In-scope / Cached | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| DK p2 (1617-1671) | 200 / 200 | ✅ CLOSED (prior BO.5) |
| DK p3 (1671-1791) | 200 / 200 | ✅ CLOSED (prior BO.5) |
| DK p4 (1791-1914) | 124 / 104 (+20 Margrethe II false-pos OOS) | ✅ effectively CLOSED |
| SH cluster (5 issuers) | 67 / 67 | ✅ CLOSED batches A+B |
| DK p1 (1513-1617) | 139 / 125 | 🔵 14 left (last leg — batch K closes it) |

⏳ **Untouched (3 buckets, 471 NIDs — all NO):**

| Bucket | Era | Gap | Pages | URL filter |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| NO p2 (1513-1657) | C2 Oslo → F3 early | 193 | 1 | `?e=norvege&st=1-2-3-47-154-5-54&cat=y&p=2&q=200&s=c&o=y` |

**Numista gap details**:
- DK p1: 14 NIDs listed in `_BO6_gaps_manifest_2026-05-19.json::denmark_gaps_by_page.p1.gap` (filter to uncached — 14 of 93 original)
- NO p2-p4 in-scope NID lists in `_BO6_audit_2026-05-20.json::in_scope_buckets.norway`
- Real Phase 2 Numista gap = **14 (DK p1) + 470 (NO p2-4) = 484 NIDs**

### Headline numbers post-audit-2

| Resource | Cache total | In-scope cached | Real gap | % done |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **ucoin** | 660 TIDs (incl. 4 batch 25 + audit verification) | 656 / 807 | **150** | **81%** |
| **Numista** | 1058 NIDs | 697 / 1181 | **484** | **59%** |

### Recommended next-session work order

0. **Numista `year_list` backfill** (HIGH — added 2026-05-22 per user N#420401 audit; **WIRED into the routine 2026-06-05**) — 122 cache entries with multi-year ranges and NO `year_list` field. Each needs a Numista-page recheck to distinguish dash-form continuous range from comma-form discrete years. Queue in `docs/handoff_numista_year_list_reharvest.yml` (sorted by year gap descending). **Why it sat at 0/122 for two weeks despite «HIGH»:** the routine batches off HARVEST_ROUTINE.md + `_harvest_handoff.json::priority_override`, NOT this handoff prose (HARVEST_ROUTINE.md §0 «this file's logic supersedes the handoff for routine batching»); priority_override was never set; and the §2.1 picker only fetches *uncached* NIDs, so a re-read of already-cached NIDs was structurally unreachable. **Fix:** added as **§2.2 Priority 0 (STANDING)** — every cron run drains 5 from the queue (re-read + §2.3-B `year_list` encoding) before any BO.7 enumeration, until empty (~24 runs). After the queue closes, re-build the affected Numista seeds + re-merge so the discrete `year_list` reaches the rendered table. Removes the §4 «source years are immutable» violation that turned N#420401's «1496, 1502» into a continuous 1496-1502 range.
1. **ucoin p1147 closure** — 10 TIDs (4 known + re-enum p2-5 for remaining 6). Closes the DK Rigsdaler 1625-1699 bucket entirely.
2. **ucoin p846 closure** — 34 TIDs of Frederik V → Christian VII Skilling/Mark Convention era. Mostly 8-Skilling + 1/6-Rigsdaler variants.
3. **Numista DK p1 closure** — 14 NIDs to close pre-1617 DK Reichsdukatenfuß gold + post-1572 First Speciedaler.
4. **ucoin p1115 OPEN** — 59 NEW TIDs (FULL bucket; Frederik IV + Christian VI Reichsdukatenfuß-era).
5. **ucoin p647 OPEN** — 47 NEW TIDs (Frederik VI Helstaten + Christian VIII 1839-1848).
6. **Numista NO p2-p4** — 470 NIDs across 3 pages (largest single remaining bucket).

### Audit cache files (canonical references)

- `scripts/cache/ucoin/_BR_audit-2_2026-05-20.json` — full per-period enumeration verification, ALL gap TID lists
- `scripts/cache/numista/_BO6_audit_2026-05-20.json` — full per-bucket enumeration with in-scope NID lists for DK p1-p4 + NO p2-p4 + SH cluster
- `scripts/cache/numista/_BO6_gaps_manifest_2026-05-19.json` — original BO.6 v2 explicit gap lists (still valid for SH-cluster + DK p1)

### Technical lessons captured this session (in SOURCES.md §13)

- §13.2 ucoin: listing-page slug-collapse trap (`?text-content-filter` solution), `\t`-separated DOM table layout, comma decimal separator, `a.href` vs `a.getAttribute('href')` Cloudflare query-string blackout, `window.<global>` doesn't survive navigation
- §13.1 Numista: per-NID DOM = HTML `<table>` rows + `<th>`/`<td>` extraction beats innerText regex; listing-page year-regex false-positives (DK p4 = 20 Margrethe II false-pos caught)
- PB-10 (PLAYBOOKS): detached-HEAD recovery + parallel-session rebase collision recovery

### Source-quirks pinpointed this session

- ucoin systematic ruler-misattribution: 4 instances flagged in `_audit_context` for seed corrections (KM-260 «Christian IV» 1665 → actually F3; KM-308 1669 «C5» → actually F3; KM-324 ND-1670 «F3» → actually C5; KM-631 1778-1785 «C9» → actually C7; KM-598 1764 «C9» → actually F5)
- DK p846 «sidecar 86» was inflated — actual listing total = 54 (SH-Holstein cross-leak in §M-era sidecar)
- DK p4 «20-NID gap» = all Margrethe II post-1972 false-positives (year-regex matched historic refs in modern descriptions) — effectively CLOSED

## Recent state changes (this session)

* **D39 — bulk_promote `no_basic_peer_only` mode + writer-bug fix**
  (2026-05-19). Extends D37 with a second mode that promotes ONLY
  unmatched unified entries with no metal+nominal peer in foundation;
  D/E/H/C-category cases (catalog/ruler/fallback disagree, low-conf
  near) stay in pending. Writer-bug fixed alongside:
  `_emit_classification_decisions` previously collapsed the flag to
  literal `True` via `bool(...)`, silently downgrading D39 →
  D37-mode-all on the first absorb. 1st `--apply`: 535 N-cases
  promoted across 8 entities, 583 D/E/H/C stay pending. 2nd
  `--apply`: idempotent (0 newly absorbed, 0 newly promoted).
  audit_v2 --quick: 0 violations. See V2_DECISIONS D39 for full
  per-entity breakdown.
* **D38 — NumisMaster builder routes country → canonical V2 entity**
  (2026-05-19). `COUNTRY_TO_ISSUING_ENTITY` mapping refactored to use
  9 canonical V2 entities directly (instead of legacy
  `schleswig_holstein_duchy` alias). Per-cadet-line routing:
  `royal_holstein` / `gottorp_duchy` / `schauenburg_pinneberg` /
  `sonderburg_duchy` / `norburg_plon_duchy` / `glucksburg_duchy`.
  Cascading rebuild: 426 `_unclassified` entries re-routed, V2
  unified regenerated, V2 final absorb-pass surfaces new pending
  for curator review. TODO §BT lists the 4 remaining builders
  (Hede/Bruun/Galster/Numista pre1541) that need similar treatment.
* **Per-case dedup methodology established** (user direction): each
  case gets full source links provided up-front, «за / проти merge»
  written out, user verifies visually before action. Auto-batching
  forbidden.
* **C-bucket auto-suppression in `build.py::_merge_seeds_into_raw`** —
  build-time filter that drops seed coins whose Hede catalog ref is
  already covered by a curated entry. Three safety guards layered on:
  metal-mismatch (cf-companion citations), weight-mismatch (>25 %
  ratio indicates cross-register KM clash or different denomination),
  year-mismatch (>10y with u.år exception). Fineness-similarity
  escape hatch on metal-mm guard for billon/silver labelling drift.
* **Cross-location seed coverage**: denmark seed entries get
  cross-checked against ALL location yamls' curated Hede refs (not
  just denmark's own) — fixes the «Glückstadt Hede entry lives in
  schleswig_holstein.yml curator but in denmark seed» pattern.
* **Bare-basename auto-suppression**: when curator has `hede: '107B'`,
  seed entry `dk-hede-c5h107` (bare basename, parser artefact) is
  also auto-suppressed alongside the explicit `dk-hede-c5h107b`.
* **KM register-aware architecture**: `KMRef {value, register}`
  schema; `Location.km_register: 'DK'`/`'SH'`; render shows bare
  «KM#» when single-entry in page default register, qualified «KM-DK#»
  + tooltip when cross-register or multi-list. Applied to case 7
  (Hede 178 → KM-DK# 25 + KM-SH# 87 same coin in two Krause volumes).
* **Verified-wins-over-unverified merge rule** (codified just now):
  CLAUDE.md §4 + `_VERIFIABLE_FIELDS` in seed builder's `_merge_one`.
  Drops `(?)`-marked values when source-attested candidate exists.
  Followed by legacy-data cleanup (45 «curated (legacy scalar)»
  fineness entries purged).
* **Proof-strike exclusion**: `_KNOWN_PROOF_PATTERNS = {"c4h20"}` in
  seed builder + explicit drop from seed yaml. CLAUDE.md §9 forbids
  proof / trial strikes; mechanism is ready for future entries.
* **«Back-to-top» floating button** in `assets/app.js`: appears at
  `max(viewport, 0.15 × page-height)` scroll threshold; custom RAF
  smooth-scroll with sub-linear duration capped 900 ms.

## Local commit state

* **Main repo**: working tree clean. Recent commits on
  `feat/v2-pipeline` not pushed (user has not granted push
  permission this turn):
  - `917452c` audit(i18n): tighten R5 — flag only Mfuß-compound translations, not bare «стопа»
  - `66a2adc` build: bump scripts/cache → galster JSON regenerations (parser refactor outputs)
  - `5df8370` build: V2 default at /, V1 fallback under /v1/ (D44)
  - `c020d11` build(v2): default bulk_promote_pending → no_basic_peer_only for steady-state
  - `07b88cb` build(v2): expand Bruun year window to 1914 + schema cleanups
* **Submodule `scripts/cache/`**: 7 commits ahead of `origin/main`
  (parse(galster) regen + earlier parse(bruun) Galster/NMD/Schive/
  Skjoldager ref patterns + parse(hede) multi-Hede header layout +
  re-parse 87 hede files + extended marken_fin_udbragt_til). Push
  needs `git -C scripts/cache push origin HEAD:main` once user
  approves; superproject pointer already references the new head
  (`3f566216`).

## Recent changes — URL routing (2026-05-20)

* **V2 → root default, V1 → /v1/ fallback** (`5df8370`, D44).
  V2 pages now render at `site/<loc>/<lang>/index.html`; V1 pages
  move to `site/v1/<loc>/<lang>/index.html`. Two landings:
  `site/<lang>/index.html` lists V2 locations (default),
  `site/v1/<lang>/index.html` lists V1. Root `index.html` redirects
  to default; `/v1/index.html` redirects to V1 fallback. Both
  subtrees emitted on every build; `--v1-only` / `--v2-only` flags
  preserved.
* **V2 invariants audit clean** post-routing (I1-I6 all pass:
  3475 final coins, 3097 unified, 4560 seed, 22 entity tags).

## Helper queries (audit reproducibility)

```bash
# Current dedup-audit candidate file (stale after auto-suppress work
# — regenerable on demand from a sweep script if needed):
#   /tmp/dup_pairs_denmark.txt
# Generated against denmark.yml + seed in a previous session;
# entirely-pending NO-KM cases extracted via the same script.

import yaml, re, json
from pathlib import Path
loc = yaml.safe_load(Path('data/locations/denmark.yml').read_text())

The full enumeration script is reproduced in the chat from this
session — search for «E1 NO-KM entirely-pending cases» if context
is preserved, or regenerate by walking the `dup_pairs_denmark.txt`
buckets.

## V2 pipeline refactor — architecture refined 2026-05-18

Late 2026-05-18 session refined the architecture into a **4-phase
fully-automated pipeline with V1 as verification anchor**. Earlier in
the session the autonomous-portion of the original 10-phase plan
landed (Phases 0-2 + 4 + 5 + bidirectional link). After user feedback
on idempotency, merge auditability, and curator-edits-via-rules, the
plan reorganised:

**New 4-phase model:**
1. Raw → typed (per resource) — script-only, unchanged
2. Typed → seed per (entity × resource) — script-only, V2 entity-keyed
3. Per-resource seeds → unified per entity (cross-source merge) — script auto-merges where confident; low-confidence cases surface for explicit curator decision in `data/v2/merge_decisions/<entity>.yml`
4. Unified seed → final fuss-distributed — script applies §8a auto-classify where confident; ambiguous cases surface for curator decision in `data/v2/classification_decisions/<entity>.yml`

**V1 = verification anchor.** V1 (`data/locations/`, `data/seed/<src>/<loc>.yml`) frozen post-bootstrap. V2 reprocesses ALL source data — existing + newly-harvested — through the 4-phase pipeline. First full-cycle run expected to map ~1:1 onto V1 curated. Promotion gate (Phase 9): «V1↔V2 diff is zero or fully explained».

**Curator role:** never edits coin fields by hand. Three decision surfaces only: (a) `data/i18n/issuing_entities.yml` (active entity set), (b) Phase 3 merge decisions, (c) Phase 4 classification decisions. Preferred path is always to update script rules so the case becomes auto-handled.

**Resolved 2026-05-18** (all 4 pending §7 decisions closed; added to
V2_PIPELINE.md §7a):
- `catalog.km` schema = `str | dict[str, str]` (dict form for cross-volume
  KMs); see `scripts/lib/v2_resolver.resolve_km_for_location`
- `coin.phase` = `str | dict[str, str]` (scalar default + dict per-location
  override); see `scripts/lib/v2_resolver.resolve_phase_for_location`
- V2 shares `templates/location.html.j2` with V1 (forked only the
  entity-badge cell to render N badges for list-form `issuing_entity`)
- `audit_v2.py` hard-blocks pre-commit from Phase 7 onwards (stricter
  than the original §7.4 «advisory» recommendation)

**Landed this session (16 commits on `feat/v2-pipeline`):**

| Stage | What |
|---|---|
| Phase 0 (bootstrap) | Skeleton `data/v2/`, audit + V1-side fix for 3 missing `issuing_entity` tags |
| Phase 1 (bootstrap) | `bootstrap_v2_final_from_v1.py` — 1317 V1 curated coins → 20 entity files. Idempotent merge-aware via `lib/seed_merge.py` |
| Phase 2 (bootstrap) | `init_v2_locations.py` — 12 V2 location display-meta files with `consumes_entities`. Preserves manual overrides on re-run |
| Schema | `Coin.issuing_entity: str | list[str]`, `Coin.phase: str | dict[str, str]`, `CatalogRefs.km: + dict[str, str]` + 7 new catalog refs (galster / friedberg / schive / skaare / etc.). `Coin.composed_of` + `Coin.promoted_to` |
| V2 build | `scripts/build.py --v1-only` / `--v2-only` + `_assemble_v2_location()` two-pass (direct + inverse-index) + per-coin phase pre-filter. Timeline + template updated for list-form `issuing_entity` |
| km-120 fix | V1 mint correction (`Royal Mint (Tower Hill)` → `Altona` per Numista N#31895) + V2 regen → `_deprecated_gesamtstaat.yml` retired |
| Phase 3.1 (new model) | `lib/v2_entity_classify.py` (mint → entity classifier) + `seed_v2_regroup.py` (V1 seeds → V2 per-entity-per-source seed yamls). Sanitisation moves catalog refs to nested `catalog:`, drops non-schema fields, coerces broken types. 2727 seed coins across hede/numismaster/bruun/galster/numista classified |
| Pipeline idempotency | All V2 scripts now merge-aware via `lib/seed_merge.merge_seed()`: re-runs produce zero file changes; curator edits in CURATED_FIELDS persist; orphan entries preserved verbatim |
| Phase 6 link | `relink_promoted_v2.py` — bidirectional `composed_of` ↔ `promoted_to` materialiser + `--audit` data-loss detection (flags weight/fineness/source-URL values present in seed but not in canonical host) |
| Doc refresh | V2_PIPELINE.md rewritten to 4-phase model; ARCHITECTURE.md §«V2 entity-keyed pipeline» extended; data/v2/README.md + CLAUDE.md preamble updated |

**Build results — V1 + V2 co-existence works:**
- `site/<loc>/<lang>/`: V1 unchanged (DK 2502, SH 842) — frozen verification anchor
- `site/v2/<loc>/<lang>/`: V2 bootstrap state (DK 3087, SH 485)
- Pre-filter drops 22 coins on V2 DK + 12 on V2 SH (cross-page-phase
  incompatibility — SH-page Phase II/III Helstaten coins rendering on DK;
  Haderslev 1591-1593 outside SH reichsdukatenfuss Phase I)

**Outstanding edge cases — DO NOT manually fix; encode as decision-file entries OR script-rule extensions:**
1. `km-120-chr-v-1787` — V1 mint corrected this session via the legacy data-edit path. Going forward, mint corrections like this come from upstream (parser cache should reflect the source's stated mint; the V1-author's «Royal Mint (Tower Hill)» was a hand-edit on top of source data).
2. `km-683-1-fr-vi-1813` dup-collision — DK side carries Bruun-specimen 1813 only; SH side is the consolidated 1813-1819 multi-mint type. **Goes into `data/v2/merge_decisions/danish_realm.yml`** when Phase 3.2 lands — explicit `merge: [dk-bruun-..., dk-numista-22803-..., dk-hede-f6h24a, ...]` declaration.
3. 4 single-Kopenhagen Helstaten coins (`km-743 / km-770 / km-x001 / km-x002`) — they were on V1 SH page despite single-Kopenhagen mint. V2 mint→entity classifier puts them in `danish_realm` (correct per §3.1 strict reading). If user wants SH visibility, the entity classifier rule should explicitly extend for «post-1813 Kopenhagen-mint Helstaten coins → joint `[danish_realm, royal_holstein]`». Goes into `lib/v2_entity_classify.py` — NOT hand-edits on individual coins.
4. 11 list-form Helstaten coins + 7 scalar `royal_holstein` SH-V1 coins use SH-page Phase II/III for `18_5_thaler`. On V2 DK they're dropped because DK has Phase I only. Resolution: Phase 4 auto-classifier needs to know about the dict-form `phase: {denmark: I, schleswig_holstein: II}` pattern — should detect when the same Müntzfuß has different periodisation across consumer pages and emit dict-form `phase` automatically. Goes into the classifier rules.
5. 6 royal_holstein DK-V1 Haderslev coins (`hede-1`, `hede-3`, `hede-6`, `hede-7b`, `hede-8b`, `hede-156`) — 5 dropped on V2 SH because year 1591-1593 falls outside SH reichsdukatenfuss Phase I range [1600, 1726]. Resolution: either widen SH Phase I in `data/v2/locations/schleswig_holstein.yml::phases` (config), or extend the auto-classifier to handle the cross-rendering case automatically.
6. 429 numismaster `_unclassified.yml` (schleswig_holstein_duchy tag without mint) — entity classifier rule needs extension for «numismaster `schleswig_holstein_duchy` without mint → consult ruler-era heuristic → assign». Phase 3.1 rule update, not per-coin manual.

**Pending scripts (4-phase model completion):**
- **`scripts/maintenance/merge_seeds_cross_source.py`** (Phase 3.2) — reads `data/v2/seed/<src>/<entity>.yml` (per-resource seeds), applies confident-merge rules + reads `data/v2/merge_decisions/<entity>.yml` for explicit curator confirmations, writes `data/v2/seed_unified/<entity>.yml` (one entry per physical coin, multi-source enriched).
- **`scripts/maintenance/classify_to_fuss_v2.py`** (Phase 4) — reads `seed_unified/`, applies §8a Müntzfuß-disambiguation pipeline + reads `data/v2/classification_decisions/<entity>.yml`, writes `data/v2/final/<entity>.yml` (fuss-distributed). Also auto-detects cross-page-phase-mismatch cases and emits dict-form `phase` for affected coins.
- **`scripts/maintenance/diff_v1_v2_final.py`** — compares V1 curated (`data/locations/`) against V2 final (`data/v2/final/`), lists every divergence. Phase 9 promotion-gate: «diff is zero or fully explained».
- **`scripts/audit_v2.py`** (Phase 7, hard-block pre-commit per §7.4) — home-file rule, bidirectional link integrity, cross-entity duplicate detection, V1↔V2 reconciliation status.
- **Native V2 builders** (post-Phase 9) — replace `seed_v2_regroup.py` post-processor with proper V2 builders consuming parser cache directly.

**Migration of bootstrap state to new model:** the current `data/v2/curated/<entity>.yml` files (bootstrap-migrated from V1 curated) will be **replaced** by `data/v2/final/<entity>.yml` (regenerated from Phase 3.2 + Phase 4 scripts) once those scripts ship. Until then, `curated/` serves as «Phase 4 equivalent» for V1-migrated coins.

**Anything touching** `_merge_seeds_into_raw` / `_assemble_v2_location` /
`scripts/lib/v2_resolver.py` / `data/v2/curated/*.yml` /
`data/v2/locations/*.yml` / `data/v2/seed/` (when Phase 3 lands) needs
to keep V1 + V2 co-existence working until the explicit «фліпай V2».

## Quirks / known traps

* **ruamel.yaml round-trip on `denmark.yml`**: re-dumping the whole
  file via `yaml.dump(doc, file)` flattens the coin list indent from
  `  - id:` to `- id:` (loses 2-space). Use line-level surgery
  (regex / sed-style) for in-place edits instead. Caught and reverted
  during the 45-entry cleanup this session.
* **`scripts/cache/numista/*.json`**: cached entries reachable via
  pypdf-style local search; live API calls subject to user's
  per-session budget (per CLAUDE.md «Numista API budget» rule,
  May 2026 quota). The «cache → check first, ask before live
  fetch» pattern is enforced.
* **Push permission is per-turn**: «push» as a verb in any earlier
  turn does NOT carry to future turns. Always wait for an explicit
  per-turn push request.
